       "'This game is suited for solo play and playing with friends It is really a unique experience and a great concept for a horror game\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is nice to unlock monsters by facing each  times to unlock them You can also unlock maps which you can use in custom case crafting by finding and escaping a maze with the blueprint\\r\\n\\r\\nEvent themed cosmetics are also a bonus in my books A fantastic game to play with friends I have had many games full of laughter playing this This game is a lot more fun with friends If you dont have those its a lot worse How can a game this basic stay so compelling  The story mode is ok but where the game really shines is the coop randomly generated mazes  Its like  games in one and youre even more powerless than Lethal Co in all of them  Definitely a blast got this game one it first came out and it was cool and it was only chapters  or something i come back to play and this game is fucking retarded now do not play Lost my sanity playing this game glowstickforloife I was playing on a map with water nd bridges I was walking ahead I saw a crocodile suddenly I looked ahead and saw a fat pig running towards me I got so scared that I jumped on the crocodile and got jumpscared  its fun with friends and one of very little good horror games on here   especially for its price Overall I really REALLY want to love this game I love the procedural generated aspect of it I love the atmosphere I love the overall aesthetic But there is so many little things in this game that just drive me and my friends up the wall whenever we try to play it for any long term sessions instead of just leaving the game open in the background\\n\\nFirst and foremost the game is just unbearably dark I am on a VA panel based monitor and any indoor map even with the brightness set to max is just basically impossible to see even with the flashlight or lantern sometimes I think this has something to do with how Unity handles global lighting  gamma since I have experienced similar issues in other Unitybased games but there really needs to be some sort of additional ambient light sources for indoor maps like Sewer and the Crypts be it candles emergency lights anything You are at such an overwhelming disadvantage on those maps my friend group and I just end up skipping them almost every time\\n\\nThere are also just several quality of life things that would improve this game immensely\\n\\n Map names below the photo thumbnails in the case files so we can see what map is being picked Some of the photo thumbnails are so dark they end up looking the same as other maps\\n\\n Improved single use map item with a player marker on it that periodically fades into focus Doesnt need to be constant but as soon as you fill in the map it becomes pretty much useless without any sense of direction of where you are especially on the MASSIVE maps\\n\\n Massive maps in general are horrifically awful to play because of how difficult they are to navigate There is basically no incentive right now to play massive maps aside from novelty Maps above a certain size need additional navigational guides and ease of pathing so that players can navigate them more readily and frequently without getting caught in endless loops Honestly if a map is as massive as the Amazon temple nonsense then it should have multiple escape avenues and puzzles that qualify Give us  puzzles on a big map but you only need to do  and then can escape Or at least make it so that if you die on these maps you spawn at the last saferoom you entered\\n\\n Completing maps on a higher difficulty should ABSOLUTELY count for challenges that specify a lower difficulty It is ridiculous that they dont and just pads out needless progressional tedium instead of rewarding people for playing on the higher difficulties\\n\\n Sometimes there is just too much interaction between the monsters and player for a puzzlebased game Some puzzles become a chore to try and complete because they dont qualify as safezones that the monsters steer clear of There needs to be a better balance struck between the amount of engagement time between the monster and player vs downtime for the player so that they tackle some of the puzzles without being constantly harassed\\n\\n Cosmetics should be highlighted For certain maps it is incredibly easy to miss them since they blend into the background of the map\\n\\nMuch of this game feels balanced around having a full stack party of  with next to no scaling mechanics They should increase the player limit to  or at least make the player limit based on the size of the map give an actual reason to play the massive maps as I wouldnt be opposed to playing them with  people instead of just me and  other person Addressed You can play with up to  people now\\n\\nI really want to love this game but there is just so many little things holding it back I dont even know why I am writing this considering only around  people total play this game anymore I just cant recommend it until some basic amenities  quality of life things are met\\n\\nUpdate Devs are taking feedback Once most of these are addressed I will change my review to a positive I love this game so much It has helped me get jump scared so many times which it takes a lot to scare me irl The labyrinths are aMazeing ILovePuns I love the puzzles  the Monsters are fantastic The items you find  get to keep if you or your team make it out alive are awesome It also has helped me towards reaction times of going around the maze while watching out for dangers but if I need to work on the puzzle I dont get foggy headed or as distracted with things as I do irl Having ADHD OCD  Psuedo Dementia from real life traumas growing up makes me very forgetful of long term tasks but my wit  reaction times have gotten better through the months  is helping me remember more irl \\n\\nThe Devs are very nice  supportive along w the Valko Game Studios Discord being enjoyable welcoming  open to feedback  suggestions \\n\\nThis game inspired me thanx to Aaron Bleyaert showing it to his Community on Twitch  I have bought the game for friends  family to enjoy  \\n\\nI am close to level  at  hours played so far  am looking forward to finishing up the Story Mode along with unlocking all the achievements  even when I get to level  if my friends are still wanting to grind to that level I will be playing with them still while we think up new creative art inspired from Labyrinthine \\n\\nEnjoy the variety of items in the Merchandise Store online  hoping there will be more prints of shirt designs in the future that are from the game  Great for those that want to immerge themselves more into their characters  for Cosplayers \\n\\nInspiration thought up\\nCreating a Pirate Map w a Sea Hag Monster  having lots of pirate hats pirate clothing printed on reg shirt  pants but with pirate boots instead of sneakers an eye patch for the Face cosmetic pirate hat for the Head cosmetic a nautical spyglass Flashlight a lighthouse lantern or a lantern made of filthy parrot feathers  a glow stick of an anchor Tasks at hand Needing to find  pull levers or collect skulls to put into a post like the seals do to open the gate but also finding a Ship Wheel like the Discs look like in The Mining Map so you can sail the ship out of the case The Safe Houses could still be dreary looking with seaweed on top of the roofs  inside having a lil gold or empty treasure chests w some sea shells or sand would be awesome It might inspire to have a few other monsters to deal with like rotting skeletons with seaweed dangling from their rib cages If the base of the map is like The Swamp and one needs to jump in the water to avoid monsters on the docks it could trigger a shark starting to hunt the prey or Kraken tentacles flailing about like The Feeler does but in the water Some broken downabandoned Lighthouses would be awesome or maybe those could be the Safe Houses\\n\\nLike I said Labyrinthine has inspired myself  a few dear friends to come together once a week on streams but we also play almost every night \\n\\nIf you like Scary Games Puzzles labyrinthsmazes  cosmetics this is top notch good times solo or with friends to fully enjoy Absolutely\\r\\n\\r\\nIts cheap and packed full of content I play several horror games all the way back to amnesia and this is up there Phasmophobia doesnt scare me anymore and seems mindless this game is the opposite Sure not everyone is into jumpscares and the sort but hear me out thats only the introduction Unique monsters and cool atmospheres makes my hiibie jeebie senses tingle and make me mind my next step \\r\\nOn the other side the story is lacking dont get me wrong its a good story intricate and all the good s h t But playing through it is a very vague experience who And why should i care Is a often asked question alas not what you want in a campaign Then again its a VERY good game for its price I played with friends and had a lot of fun You should too My friends and I made a custom hardcore casr yesterday with the brick maze map accidentally placed  glowing guys and we almost died from laughing our assess off One of my friend has PTSD now from dying at every corner\\n\\n Highly recommend the flexibility of maps enemies and variations gives you hours of endless scares and fun The main campaign to this game is actually so fun The built in proximity chat is pretty good The puzzles arent overly complicated but the mazes are easy to get lost in which is great campaign was amazing and the case files are even better tons of fun and replayability Its a nice little game to play togheter the story is very good and at first a little scary The map designs are good and made with love after the story you can play it with maps and small quests i hope they make another game like this or some story updates with new maps or other content \\nhave a nice day and fun by playing this game I absolutely love this game I really hope the developers create more chapters in this game as a continuation or sequel to chapters  through  Theyve got the extra maps where they can add to the story or follow up with a new one Regardless I  recommend this game its worth the price imo  an enjoyable experience overall and great fun to watch your friends shit themselves  This is one of my favorite coop horror games that I have returned to for two more play throughs The first few chapters were peak but sadly the last  chapters did not live up to the standards the originals did However they are still worth playing through with friends   \\n Get lost scream get hunted blame your friends Chaos at its best  Endless glow sticks \\n\\n Very fun game to play with friends The fact that there are collectibles keeps the game interesting and they are still adding for each event Despite all my days I still feel like a rat in a maze  Good game  would recommend just expect to die a lot and youll be fine  Can you make it easier to tell what maps they are on the board Amazing game can be both funny and terrifying depending on how you want to play it Please for the love that is all make more of this game a second or something what an amazing play for a tiny premium Turn this horror genre into a AAA one day Such a good game i want this on a massive scale with dumb founding puzzles LETS GO do not let this game die Do you love puzzles Do you love horror Do you love running for your life in hopes of finding the safe house before getting snatched up by the monster chasing you If so This is the game for you Seriously though This game has come a long way since Beta and honestly the artwork time and effort is visibly seen with each map The devs have done such an amazing job and continue to do so with each update  would recommend Love this game Always get a good scare out of playing it and it has amazing audio and graphics Definitely give it a try if you havent the zoo area was really a cool idea\\nbut in general its just an ok horror game with  chapters out of  that are really mazes\\nwhere the     were the good ones\\n\\nPR  This game is worth the price The graphics are awesome and the customization of the settings are easy to understand and work with Although the maps can get a bit repetitive I love the overall play through of both the story mode as well as the case files This game freaks me out and gives me anxiety at every corner but I enjoy every bit of it the thrill of not knowing around the corner depending on a certain sound it gets me every time and I love it Friends and I enjoy this game a lot Have definitely gotten our money out of it and more Even after  hours you can still get a jump scare sometimes Bonus points that they have kept adding a couple new cosmetics to make players from last year feel like there is still something to hunt for during the holidays One of the best indie horror games on the market\\nIts got its own  thrilling scary player coop chapter campaign which takes approximately  hours to complete and if thats not enough and you are wanting more its got something called Case Files where you are put into a randomly generated maze that can  off  different sizes and multiple difficulty levels You run around trying to complete the objective while at the same time trying to stay away from multiple different monsters that are there to try and stop you unlocking the exit\\n\\nFor about  Labyrinthine is well worth the price great story mode with friends for the first time after the first maze i promise the game gets a lot more interesting  outside of the story mission the procedurally generated maps are too samey and the monsters are too one dimensional its not surprising most players will stop playing the game after the story because of this either way worth the price on sale or not \\n\\nspoiler alert please add the random gate mechanic to spice up these maps i enjoyed the light from the miner it created a lot of tension from friend or foe theres so much that can be done to spice up these mapsmonsters doing so will truly elevate this games replayability Really fun game to play with friends I enjoyed to the fullest Nice puzzles and tactical thinking  teamwork Waiting for cryo so i can buy it D idc what ppl sayyy i love this game sm so good  scary Game was pretty good until level  Then it becomes a slogRNG fest Theres an enemy at the end that is so fast you have no chance unless you get lucky There is literally not enough time to get from safe space to safe space and thats assuming you know exactly where they are You will be absolutely massacred without a map Just terrible design It took me several hours to slog through this level then I get trolled at the end Maybe I could tolerate this if the level wasnt so long and tedious\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the game is tough but fair How did this get through playtesting  stars This game is terrifying and fun at the same time The amount of playtime lasted much longer than I thought it would The game is fun though it can be repetitive  I feel like there arent extremely defined methods to escape enemies  Overall it is worth the cost Very addictive and if you feel the need to collect every cosmetic the game will never end Replayability is  though Great for groups and friends This game starts with potential but nosedives hard in the second half By Chapter  its a repetitive slog through uninspired dull corridors filled with monsters that are neither scary nor challengingjust obnoxiously placed to waste time The pathfinding elements seem designed solely to frustrate as my friends and I found ourselves wandering aimlessly following a monster purely out of exhaustion and apathy for whatever progress we were supposed to be making If you insist on playing do yourself a favor and quit around Chapter  or  because beyond that its a relentless descent into poorly designed levels that drain any excitement the game initially had This isnt a horror experience its a lesson in how to kill a games momentum If your into co op horror this is the perfect game to test if your about it or not Ending was half assed story and level design went drastically down hill after the first  chapters Fun with friends but in the end ultimately disappointing in the end I get so scared I spin in circles Big man step on me Clown stab me Lady eat me Backrooms take me Amazing game lot of fun especially with friends Labyrinthine is less of a horror game and more of a complex method for discovering which of your friends will abandon you at the first sign of a demon Picture this youre standing in the middle of a hedge maze whispering where are you only to realize youre asking your own sense of selfpreservation because your socalled friend sprinted the other way the second they heard footsteps really fun and scary game to play with the bois played at alpha and came back again and was not disappointed Love this game ive played it all the way through and still love it would be great if there was a lan coop option id definitely got more out of it i love horror games and this isbone of my faves Great game which you can repeat with friends and earn new cosmetics Newseasonal cosmetics are always fun to collect too Story chapters also are fun to go through Would recommend for those who like coop and jump scaresbeing chased by original tactical killers Game is one of my favourites\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been playing this game since before the full completed game was released and I have loved playing it every time From the storymode to the case files it is always fun to get lost in a maze with friends chased by monsters Labyrinthine is a thrilling coop horror game that keeps you on edge with its eerie atmosphere clever puzzles and chilling jump scares The immersive environment and cooperative gameplay make it an unforgettable adrenalinepumping experience Perfect for friends who love to get scared together x replayability than any other horror game like it enough variation in the map types to keep you entertained core gameplay loop is solid and i still get scared after playing it for a while The last mine level is pure agony but if you eat the glow sticks it gives you the super power to finish it I Strongly Recommend Labyrinthine\\r\\nHeres My Honest Opinion About Labyrinthine I Really Love This Game It Has No Flaws Its In Great Hands What I Mean By That The Developers That Are Working On This Game Cares About It Now Heres The Pros And Cons List This Is Exactly What I Experienced In The GameCommunity\\r\\n\\r\\nPros\\r\\n Gameplay\\r\\n Balancing\\r\\n Customization\\r\\n Everything Is Free\\r\\n Fun With Friends Even Solo Is Fun\\r\\n Dlc Is Purely Cosmetic\\r\\n Has Amazing Difficulty To It\\r\\n Developers Actually Cares About There Game\\r\\n\\r\\nTheres No Cons\\r\\n\\r\\nIf You Read Up To This Point I Appreciate You Reading My Review Please Give This Game A Try With Friends Or Solo Thank You For Reading This Have A Great DayNight Thankfully Ive collected the same yellow visor that rests atop the crown of my head x Good job this game is so much fun i love finding new cosmetics  i hope there is more added soon Me and my friends really enjoyed the story maps but after a while the gameplay becomes repetitive Its a great laugh for the sake of  getting loads of hours getting chased and solving puzzles deffo worth the money Really good game lots of mazes and mental quizzes to get through plus scary monsters and challenges to beat Good fun with friends better playing with  or more players  I wish you could mod in your own monsters so I could finally relive that dream where Larry Bird was chasing me through a graveyard The good The game is fun with friends Spooky evan\\n\\nTHE BAD The Devs NEED to ensure that maps arent a single long tunnel When there are  enemies to run past and nowhere to go it is a huge pain in the ass hardest part about this game is keeping my mouth shut  i love this game it makes me want to die it is soo fun and entertaining i especially chapter  where the pig and the bone brother chase you and do not let you breathe wow please make more story modes\\n\\nbeautiful game If you didnt play Labyrinthine with you friends you should play it again with them Where do i begin\\r\\nThis game simply put is AHEAD of its time  friends convinced me to play it with them\\nWe had a realy good time\\nActually playing it around Halloween while you try to immerse yourself in it was a good decision\\nFinished the game and we loved it Coop Horror game with puzzles you have to solve together to advance to the next checkpoints Amazing game and different Mundane walking simulator  of my brain stimulated from holding w shift and pressing left click to drop my sixtyfourthousandth glowstick because god forbid I lose where I am in a map the size of Fallout  but with a quarter of its content somehow possible Game lacks creativity passion depth of character Monster mechanics are novel for about five minutes before you realize theyre about as different as oranges and tangerines The game being procedural generated doesnt excuse making the tasks exorbitantly tedious Each task is an exercise in endurance instead of enjoyment Labyrinthine excels at making me learn new things by being so unplayable that Im forced to read a book or watch Netflix in the background If youre looking for a game that makes you rawdog the W key the most exciting part of your day this ones for you For everyone else theres always paint to watch dry In my opinion it was fun at the beginning but then it turned into a walking simulator But for the price its a good game Great game  lots of stuff and definetely worth the money Definetely made my family mad by screaming my ass off at am Fun with friends If you like horror then this is a good buy This game is definitely the best multiplayercoop horror Ive played with my friends me and my friends have a load of fun time just playing the case files together We find ourselves playing for what feels like just a few minutes really turns into a few hours and definitely some late nights We played it a while back and just recently got back into it and we are having so much fun We collect all the things in the case files and were working on collecting the secret keys in the story Thats taking forever though \\n\\nTLDR BEST GAME EVER  RECOMMEND BEST WITH FRIENDS OMG I LOVE THIS GAME I have played through the story a few times and done many case file and I still get spooked from time to time If you enjoy puzzles and scares this is the game for you  Im obsessed One of my favourite horror games Its even got the backrooms The game as a whole is great I enjoy the cosmetics quite a bit \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only bad things would be that in forest you cant really see the glow sticks and that leads to a lot of confusion and irritation when you use glow sticks to know where you have been I have the dlc to have more glow stick colors but I wish there were a few more so we dont have to use colors multiple times in a map The only other is we have noticed recently that the rats are reacting to us even when we are not moving I realized they hear the flashlight glow sticks dropping and when you are revived which is fine cause those are actions but sometimes we will just sit there no mic not pressing anything and they will run right up to us This game is a lot of fun with friends I love that you can hunt for cosmetics solve puzzles and get those jump scares in for content only draw back is that you cant see them on your person Perhaps itll be in rd person some day My friends and I have been playing this game since chapter one released Every week we roll up some custom case files and hunt for fun cosmetics and consumables We ran through each chapter as they came out and then again after the full release We plan on indoctrinating a fourth so we can run through it one more time for those cool masks\\nThe monsters are still panicinducing after a few years of playing and the maps are unnerving\\nI HIGHLY recommend this game Good job Valko Fun cooperative play Fair amount of replayability Room for improvement but devs are still adding content Play often with family members and we have a good time Would definitely recommend to those looking for a fun game to casually play with friends or family Some of the funnest and funniest moments you can have scaring yourself Unreasonable amounts of good spooks and content for the price I love scrounging around in pitch black catacombs leaving a trail of glowsticks that is sure to confuse me later Highly recommend playing the story missions first then jumping into contracts The story on this game is amazing and what really solidified my appreciation for this game I was first introduced and shoved into searching for cosmetics and as a noob at the time it was a rough go at things and I put this game down for a while Picked it back up and played the story and it made the joy and understanding of contracts much more fun for me Spoopy Great with friends and case files allow replayability bruh allllllllll Thattttt JUST TO K iLLLLLLL MYSELF  wtf is that bruh good ass game but the ending may be the worst in history  games in  Story mode is interesting but the case files are why I keep playing this Friends and I spend hours cosmetic hunting Super fun game with a great community I highly recommend this game I loved playing through the puzzles with my friends Even though the story mode maps stay the same you never know how long each map will take you because of the way the monsters behave Case files are also really fun I loved the uncertainty of where everything would be each time or what monsters youd face until you meet them in the case files The fear experienced in this game is not like any other Not the best horror game not the best multiplayer game not the best VR game not the best puzzle game not the best story So what does this game do well Its fun casual straightforward gives a lotta bang for your buck and just scary enough to play with friends who arent totally into scary stuff The game loop is engaging and makes you want to play more Im not thrilled about the FOMO content but even if youre not playing during events theres more than enough content to keep you satisfied just look at my play time Id say what really impresses me is the passionate responses I see from the devs theyre truly honest hardworking people just trying to make a good game Knowing this I was inclined to give a recommendation after seeing mixed in recent reviews Its cheap and you get the gist of the game pretty quick so give it a try and if its not your style you can refund it

this game a try for the price it is a gem  Conclusion after  hours playtime\\nIn my opinion is this game the best Coop Horrorgame there is The amount of fun we had together was incredible Ive never felt so good about a  game After you completed the Story you can play more in the case files wich are maps with a task to do to escape While you do this there are some monsters which want to see you dead I think i could play this for more than  hours and it wouldnt get boring because every map has a different seed and different monsters I wouldnt exaggerate to say this is the best coop game on steam Everyone who says that this game is bad just hadnt played it right or just played the story which is tbh not that spooky compared to the other parts of the game It may sound weird but this game really changed my life I cant have a day without playing atleast one round of Labyrinthine This game is worth every penny of the  I paid for  the supporter edition which gives you some new accessories and a golden name tag I love this game \\n\\n White Wool Ill try to be as detailed as I can in this review\\n\\nIll begin with graphics and maps Id say in terms of graphics and optimization this game seems to do a good job Ive played it with my  S and my  and I never really had any graphical issues that dropped my FPS except for the Docks Case files but I assume it has to do with the amount of water around the map There arent really any points you can accidentally access and fall through any points of the map without using cheats Even then You are immediately teleported back to spawn as a failsafe all without wasting a life Not to mention the glowsticks can be infinite and they dont lower FPS on all  of my GPUs Ive played this game with At least  glowsticks in one room only drops FPS by MAYBE  FPS maybe even  Each map has some cool detail and texture and some maps are just straight up beautiful\\n\\nVR\\nVR works pretty well for the most part aside from the stretching of models which can only be countered to some extent My biggest gripe which works as a doubleedged sword is that when you are in VR the musical cues which can add some immersion to the game is practically nonexistent Its very quiet But granted I havent hopped on my VR in a good month or two but I havent seen any patch notes about it so I will assume it hasnt been addressed just yet I can see both arguments that the lack of musical cues for monsters such as the Pig make it more immersed thus making it more terrifying to turn corners with no idea what may or may not be there Basically better jumpscares At the same time hearing the music crescendo not knowing whether youre running the same path as the monster adds more suspense I dont believe the quiet music is intentional as you could just turn the music higher or lower in the settings\\n\\nReplayability\\nThe story starts off alright the first chapter serves as a pretty good tutorial From there the difficulty seems to ramp up a bit and the final chapter takes a really long time to complete The story is good enough to make it all the way through but after the rd time playing through the story with friends it got old pretty quickly Thankfully the game has whats called Case Files which is why people continue playing the game Each Case File is a randomly generated maze and sometimes even monsters which may or may not be specific to that map type There also may be a cosmetic in the map and this cosmetic has a very high chance to be a common cosmetic My only  gripes about the cosmetics is that there are some extremely overrare items that are already specific to a map andor monster making the grind absolute hell Not to mention there are some eventspecific cosmetics that may or may not be announced ie St Patricks event This event lasted hardly  days and to those of us with  jobs or even more hours left little to no time to get all the cosmetics It was also not announced so by the time some of us realized  days have already passed or more\\n\\nThe monsters of the game have their own uniqueness to them in not only abilities but in looks Not to mention the game has had crossovers like the Backrooms or Silent Hill type map and monster Im not too sure if thats what its based off of dont take my word on that one\\n\\nPersonally I think the story can have more to offer There are some case file maps that could probably have a pretty good addition to story chapters should there be room for expansion Carnival Chapter Bamboo Forest Chapter Sewers etc\\nI feel like this game has more and more potential that could be seized Hopefully with future additions the replayability of the game will be further renewed Perhaps new maps new monsters or more cosmetics preferably with decent rates\\n\\nAdditionally I have not personally found a member ingame who is toxic or outright rude Ive found this community is probably one of the best\\n\\nOverall I would recommend this game for its price its fun with friends If you get the game when its on sale Id say thats pretty much a steal Great horror game totally didnt scare me The spider scared me    When I was started to play it was on open beta so I was decide to put a curtain on most of the glitches or technical issues and waited to game to make a full release before writing any comment \\r\\n\\r\\n   So first if I need to confirm yes some of the glitches still exist but worse is there is more issues to worry such as like holes in the map that you can fall without a heavy effort AI glitches which was a problem on open beta as well or even in some cases AI fixes target on you and not changes it how much you try \\r\\n\\r\\n   About story part in open beta it was short but kinda acceptable but with later chapters that added on full release which it turned to worse Next chapters that added start to feel less worked on and the last chapter was completely felt like I was stuck in a time loop about map design \\r\\n\\r\\n   For the endings and lore I am not sure what to say but I guess best way to say was it feels half ended like in some part of the production they decide to change the writer or scraped a better idea and gone with a filler that might tie the loose ends but failed miserably All chapters somehow feels like they taken from different dimensions and someone tried to put them together using cinema magic \\r\\n\\r\\n   For gameplay basics are not complicated WASD is move you have jump and sprint There is gadgets that can do various stuffs too but understanding the AI of monsters is more vital because either you play with only looking to the ground or crouching or constantly running anyways As I can understand monsters roam near you to give that constant pressure feeling but they mostly feel like they have no resting time if you get into a safe house and wait for a little bit it becames more clear Most of the times dead ends feels more safe than the safe houses for that reason About maps labrinths are completely randomised but you can came across with maps full of countless dead ends oftenly Older maps feels okay but new released maps have very obvious isses that like I adressed previously on the above\\r\\n\\r\\n   About design choice I am not sure what to say since I am on more of the side of the artistic approach I cant be sure but monsters feels like they taken from unity asset store I will be more optimistic if I was talking about a story based game but I expect little more design for a game which looks like  focused on atmospheric experience trying to find an exit on labrinthine with horror addition\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now my point is  about the game Incredibly fun lots of scare potential in the case files after finishing the main story and the replayability of the story is high anyways if you wait a while between runs  Plus the dev team is amazing  Monster filled mazes in the dark Oh hell yeah Sooo much fun I pissed my pants from the hentai I read while exploring the catacombs since this is so dog wank to play\\n since you can draw dks with glowsticks I started playing this game over  years ago and to this day I still have a great time playing it I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great horror game to play The Valko Games Studio team has done a great job making this game and they stayed in contact with their community even to this day to make the game even better I cant wait to see what you guys come out with next Words cant describe how good this game is but numbers can  It has great replay value awesome monsters with different mechanics puzzlesobjectives pretty simple but enough to make you stress and feel that longing for an exit while anything could be lurking any corner and cosmetics are kinda cool\\r\\n\\r\\nBeen playing with my friends since I got this and I am almost level  and still not bored of it For its value get it if you got friends D One of my fave games My boyfriend and  brothers are playing tomorrow and I CANNOT wait to show them the scary things in the game They have no idea whats coming Told them not to look at the trailer and trust HIGHLY RECOMMEND Absolutely love the game I have been playing from the very beginning and was around for every chapter release Honestly the first few times you play this game its very fun and exciting The more you play it and the further you get along the more you can tell the devs got lazy The game gets tedious and repetitive and no real reason to replay The case file game mode is boring and not worth the time Honestly wouldnt bother playing this game unless you want to be frustrated with game and being camped by monsters constantly if youre incompetent like me find someone whos willing to complete the game with for you No easter event makes me think the game has already been abandoned as they focus on their new game\\nI have still enjoyed the game but definitely only because I was playing with friends Great game for mazes horrors and puzzles with a story mode and just random seeds map generated games can be between  mins to  mins and a few options for customizing the experience Screamed like a lil bitch but overall good game ps fucking hate the carnival map and those bitchass canons I love this game I play with  friends regularly its a quick and easy game to pick up and play casually with never ending replay ability\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Love this game the collectibles are great its fun to make your character unique the monsters are definitely frightening and the maps are super immersive Never had this much fun with friends in a game before well worth the money would wake up the neighbours again The story is fun and it is easy to come back and play a few rounds with the homies Fun game to play with friends Interesting story mode the ending wasnt that good tho As far as horror games go this game is next to Phasmo in quality It may not be the scariest at times but take four people for a first play through you WILL have a good time Great game I highly recommend if you like chill horror games with friends Great game lots of replayability with contracts etc and quite jumpscary I survived a couple days more than that other guythink hes one of the monsters now Turning innocent hedge mazes into friendshiptesting nightmares Solve puzzles scream in unison and test whether your friendships are as labyrinthine as the maze itself Good luck finding your way outfrom the maze and potential arguments this game made me enjoy puzzles and mazes i love the scares the proximity chat the teamwork thats required chefs kiss I had so much fun playing this game with friends we played for over  hours in total so far\\n\\nThe suspense of a monster coming up and splitting up your team you then getting lost in the maze but continuing on to gather the objectives while youre at it now having to deal with monsters alone in the dark then finally eventually running into one of your friends after  minutes of wandering around really happy to see them is such a great thing to experience\\n\\nThis game is the first one that made me enjoy horror games But rather than a horror game I like to think of this game as an adventure game more about exploration Its also nice that as you play maps especially if you get stuck in them long enough you trigger the parts of your brain responsible for mapping starting to memorize familiar areas as you get attached to them Its an interesting feeling\\n\\nOh also one must not underestimate the amount of laughs you get when you or your teammate screams when a monster surprises one of you As long as youre playing using the proximity voice chat which I highly recommend\\n\\nNote my recommendation for the minimum number of players for the campaign\\nCase    player\\nCase    players\\nCase    player\\nCase    players or  players if one of them is experienced\\nCase    players or  players if one is experienced\\nCase   definitely  players they shouldve at least given us the option to kill Joan Chill escape game with jumpscares\\nAmazing game idea My friend and I are addicted to collecting clothing collectible D not so scary most of the time but still pretty fun horror experience\\nneeds some more content tho Good game Fun to play and online multiplayer so you meet a lot of people this game is awesome  but  think it need is the reconnect capability  please add that in the future updates  thx  developers    Best scary game I have ever played Had a great time with my boys playing Looked forward to it everyday until we beat it Crazy story line this game is pretty good game with good monsters and puzzles Even after replaying this for the fourth time I still get jump scared by the ghost signs that pop out of the bushes This is game well worth it fun to play with friends A lot of puzzles and mazes Definitely need some knowledgeable teammates in order to pass this game without looking up videos on how to pass it Would recommend to anyone \\nWish there was more levels to this game Super fun to play with friends I really like that every other course is a labyrinth and every other course is a more open plan with a bit more exploration Would love to play even more sad to see it end where to start this game absolutely loved it it was horriblescary soo bloody jumpyscary me and my mate played it two player no Vr and really enjoyed it Most of the levels we were too scared to move the puzzles where good the enemies where skitzyscary we had an absolute crease good time laughing at each other screaming but the ending Fuck me that was some fallout  sacrifice yourself when no need shit But for  pound a game that lasted over  hours of god fun totally worth every penny LOVE this game I bought it because I saw some streamers playing the main story and while I had seen almost a full play through I still wanted to try it myself The main story is awesome has collectibles and varying challenges I had noticed the case files during our initial play through and suggested it to my usual gamer group one night One night of playing the case files and we were addicted The game can be challenging at times And I would not recommend playing drunk lol but you can find levels that are a bit more forgiving  for moral boosting purposes I also love the new feature where they show you how you and the team progressed through the different labyrinths Ultimately Highly recommend The replayable cases were way more fun than I expected them to be A lot of game for a low price Extremely fun game The story is vast and enjoyable with different monsters and  chapters each with its own enemies and map After you complete the story or before its up to you you can do Cases which are like missions that you can complete for cosmetics and to level up Highly recommend  i started playing this game nearly  years ago i have loved the game and watching an updates from new cosmetics to new maps the devs have nonstop created an enjoyable experience all year round with suggestions and input from the evergrowing community and staying on the path to a fully released game with a beautiful vr experience i cannot wait to see what future updates are instore for labyrinthine and further games created by Valko Studios Add more little ghosts so ethan will shit himself more h Labyrinthine Tasting Notes h\\n\\n\\tA friend and I purchased this game a while back thinking it would be a fun spooky experience for us  We played for a little bit got a bit bored of the story mode and stopped playing  About a year later the friend decided to challenge himself and get every achievement for every game in his Steam library  That included this game\\n\\tAfter approximately  hours of gameplay enlisting the help of another friend and copious amounts of shouting and alcohol we have decided to write a review of our experience with Labyrinthine  I have never written a Steam review before but I was so motivated by how frustrating an experience we had while playing this game that I got those friends together and collected our thoughts  Below are some of the main and reoccurring frustrations we ran into during our playtime\\n\\n\\tb Bad procedural generation b\\no\\tMultiple maps generate too many deadend branches and monsters dont move enough to provide the proper ability to exit  Having to camp out at the entrance or in safe areas for extended periods of time runs rampant in this game leading to lots of dull moments\\no\\tMonster numbers dont scale with map size vs difficulty  Extreme Giant maps are actually incredibly boring compared to Extreme medium maps  There is no reason to do larger than mediumsized maps  Item generation does not scale nor do the objectives  Engagement feels very low on larger maps\\no\\tToo many maps start off with long boring single paths  Lots of dead ends at the beginning of a map that leads to having to sit and wait at the entrance for extended periods of time  The time waiting can vary depending on what monsters are spawned and whether they move out from the single path or not\\no\\tSwamp maps are too large  Does not fit the size description at all  Mediumsized swamps felt like very large or even giantsized maps\\no\\tMultilevel maps feel halfbaked  They do not consider the second level when calculating map size and there are usually barely any branching paths  It is super easy to be surroundedblocked off from progressing by a single monster that camps a single spot which leads to more waiting as previously mentioned\\no\\tDifficulty does not match up  Some maps generate much harder than others  From our experience some very small and normal difficulty maps have been near impossible while other very large and extreme difficulty maps have been cake walks\\n\\n\\tb Enemy Design b\\no\\tBlack Pig  Having this enemy immediately charge makes it near impossible to dodge  Especially on a map with tight corridors such as the sewers\\no\\tMarionette  Is incredibly frustrating to have the marionette drop from the ceiling repeatedly and create situations where we found ourselves backtracking endlessly\\no\\tBride enemies should NOT be on twolevel maps  Being able to go through walls in all dimensions creates impossible to escape scenarios especially when climbing or descending stairs\\n\\n\\tb Item Consumption b\\no\\tWe feel as though we are not fairly compensated for collecting duplicate cosmetics  Receiving  tickets for a cosmetic which are quite rare to begin with feels like a slap in the face  A stamp seems to be a more appropriate reward for finding such duplicates  One change that could also be made is varying the reward for a duplicate depending on the cosmetic rarity\\n\\n\\tb Grind Feels Tedious b\\no\\tBad puzzle design specifically guessandcheck puzzle  No skill or ability to improve  Just used to waste time in the games  The puzzle made sense in the story mode however it felt as though it was lazily cut and pasted to the case files  It is also incredibly difficult to do with certain enemies camping ie slowmoving Brides\\n\\n\\tb Summary of Feelings b\\no\\tThe game feels buggy and still has an earlyaccess feel  Obvious problems seem missed but would have been noticed with more playtesting  We felt as though this game was more of a chore to engage with than anything else \\no\\tThe idea of playing the game was scary enough that we had a player have a nightmare about physically playing the game  Do not confuse this with the game being actually scary  It is only scary the first time you play it and even then not by much\\n\\n\\n\\tHere are two examples of bad gameplay we experienced written during the time we were playing  We would have more but it was towards the end of our Labyrinthine journey when we started recording these\\no\\tCarnival map  Trapped in safe room with no ability to even play the game because two Smileys camped outside the entire time  Cant outrun Smiley and would not leave so effectively softlocked unless we wanted to take a death\\no\\tGeneral choke points ie  Witch kept camping the only path to exit Super fun and tons of scary monsties that I havent even faced yet Coop is very fun Lots of different enemies environments and puzzles Overall good game Its giving spook Fun to play with friends The monsters are pretty dope\\nGlad I bought this game Game is criminally underrated My friends and I have been having a blast on this The campaign was a lot of fun and relatively short The multiplayer is tons of fun For  its worth spending you wont regret it Havent played VR on this but still worth it as a PC game Fun game Think it got VR horror game of the year Great fun with friends I hate the leeches I hate them all Wheres the salt This is perhaps one of my favorite multiplayer games and theres a lot of fun stuff in it Theres a lot of maps randomly generated so you never beat the same exact map twice a lot of monsters and a lot of things to get In the maps you can get a lot of different cosmetics and you can get especially fun ones around holidays They have a short story mode and just maps for fun Ive owned this game for around a year now and its always one my friends and I will go back to Very much a recommended game  \\n\\nupdate \\nps you can shoot your friends with a flare and it will stun them They can become tasty monster treats that way  This game is super fun and scary If you dont get the right items sometimes it can get frustratingrepetitive when you get lost in a maze BRING A MAP Maybe there should be a hint mode that will hint to where you need to go after so much time elapses and you cant find anything That might make it a little better Wandering around after being completely lost in a maze is the only downside\\n\\n What a nice surprise it was for this kind of money The trill is real  Gameplay with up to  people is great and a lot of fun Only downside i can think off is that there are YET not many people playing it so sometimes its hard to get a full party But you can play it anyway with  to  people Yeah  people is the most fun  I loved this game I like jumpscares and normally stay with phasmophobia I seen my friend playing this and loved the jumps for this I have already had a few excellent jumpscares and the different monsters are good My biggest problem is that I am terrible with navigation so dont play it alone or youll get lost and bored I enjoy it playing with others and streaming so people can giggle at me jump One of the best horror games with friends love proximity chat and all the customisation options for the game scariest creature is the pop up hedge clowns tho For those who are reading the This game does not deserve VR GOTY reviews Id like to give my opinions\\n\\nbMost recent negative reviews are from players who more than likely splurged on an Index didnt invite anyone to play with them and have an hour or less time in game spoilerAnd have k hours in VRChatspoilerb\\n\\nIve been playing the game frequently before it was in the running for VR GOTY Around  hours or so And I can definitely say the game is a bunch of fun bWITH FRIENDSb Keep in mind not all players need VR to play together The story can be challenging depending on how good your navigation skills are but the meat of this game lies within the case files When I started playing I found most of my fun in seeing each new monster presented to me and all the different maps Now that I have seen most of what the game has to offer I collect cosmetics and try to grow my collection as much as I can The player creates their own experience Want a challenging maze running experience Small map Extreme Difficulty Want even more of a challenge Create a custom case file Small map  monsters Want to go to the Steam reviews and complain about how this game got GOTY Have  friends and complain about how you have to navigate a maze after buying a maze navigation game This game has been absolutely amazing fun and terrifying Nothing says stress more than a cardboard cutout of a ghost Highly recommend playing this with your friends As a big fan of the horror coop genre this is probably the most fun Ive ever had With friends\\nPersonally I havent played the multiplayer gamemodeminigame thing but Im a big fan of the story mode I had a lot of fun on every level The variety of spooky creatures was entertaining and the variety on the levels Most were labyrinths But hey being chased through a labyrinth by a monster will never not be exciting terrifying and downright hilarious \\n\\nI understand not enjoying the game while playing solo but mannnnn At least play the game how it is supposed to be played Its quite scummy to review bomb a game because youre salty over a loss andor you didnt give it a fair shot an awful lotta reviews with less than  hour playtime Its a  dollar game A solid  hours of playtime with friends Well worth it The campaign is fine but the meat of the game is definitely in the Case Files\\nMy favourite maps include Draculas Castle Carnival Marionette is awful though and Legally Distinct Foggy City Posting this review after the reveal of GoTY I have quite a bit of time in this game its definitely made from a team who cares not only about their work but their community too its depressing to see this game that Ive fallen in love with get review bombed by sore losers if you have a problem with the results take it up with steam dont start bombing another game cause you didnt win congratulations to all the other games that got nominated for VR GOTY that alone is an achievement in itself and to be quite honest a lot of the community thought other games would win just try to be sportsmans like If you do try out the game know that there is more to the game then just the story mode I implore you to try the game out with friends its a good fright and very fun when you understand mechanics plus theres a whole array of cosmetics you can find and hunt down I really enjoyed the game my friends and I bought the game knowing nothing about it Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands Why does the spider have hands \\n\\n Fun game just gotta use your brain The fact that people are mad over the reward is pretty sad Its not that serious top VR horror deserves VR of the year some much fun with friends when it splits you up always a blast these other bad reviews are idiots This game is a truly amazing spooky puzzle game to play with friends It is a bit wonky but thats the joy of games in this genre and style I give it a solid  out of  overall Great Game for those who love cosmetic grinding with a touch of horror The jump scares scare me more then the actual monsters I love this game so much and I cant get enough of it This game is so much fun and the mazes are never the same You can play this solo it is hard on some levels but it is so much more fun to play with friends Dare I say even mess with your friends when it comes to certain monsters Not only is there different mazes you also get to find cosmetics to decorate your character with so these mazes do for sure come with more than just the reward of getting to the end \\n\\nI enjoy in the mazes you have to finish criteria before you get to the end or have to get away from certain enemies Some of course are far easier then others Unless you have the unfortunate luck of being ambushed by  at once\\n\\nThe game devs are always after feed back as well and are very keen on hearing what others would like to say to help make this game better for everyone If you stream a member of the team might also pop in to ask how you are enjoying it\\n\\nSo if you like random mazes that are never the same and monsters and spooky places this is a must have played  people for  min and as soon as we found the cosmetic the game crashed  Could use some more recent updates as it is a bit buggy at times especially when playing with friends However the puzzlesscare factor with most levels is outstanding albeit occasionally funny Unfortunately the longer the game goes on the easier to cheese some levels become aside from the mines\\n\\nOverall solid game with solid replayability and the missions mode is solid as well  I absolutely adore this game the community is super sweet and welcoming as are the Devs The game is amazing I love doing the cosmetic hunts  the cases Definitely recommend playing this game Really nice terror experience Must give the chills on VR GOOD STUFF  quality good creativity normal puzzle bad cuz not enough yet still very fun This game has been a blast I enjoy all the giggles and scream my friends and I get from playing this My life is a like a labrynthine\\nIm lost and scared in a maze and theres a giant pig with a cleaver chasing me Spooky game fun to play with friends  I recommend not using Discord and just using the proximity voice chat ingame makes it spookier GL  After giving this game my all ing all achievements I can say while its chapter and story system are very good and well designed if youre the type to  games or care about achievements then this game will ruin you This game maybe has at most  hours of replayability but the achievements milk it to over  hours making the game so dry and repetitive I am legitimately so happy to quit this game and never touch it again buying everything in the shop should have been the last achievement it already takes a ridiculous amount of tickets to buy it all and maybe even the  unique cosmetics would have been okay but spending  tickets in the shop is just abysmal Want to play anything other than hardcore Nope you make maybe  tickets on a good map without hardcore And how many hardcore cases would you have to do to get it Probably around  depending on how many youve had so far Not only are they extremely rare to roll if you dont have custom case stamps or millions of rerolls but having no lives in any of them just to make the grind to get this achievement bearable should really be thought about or at least reworked\\n\\nMake it easier to find tickets or give more bonuses depending on player level perhaps but overall while I enjoyed this game in the beginning the way the devs have laid out achievements and how much nonexistent repetitive replayability it has has ruined the experience for me and more than likely will never touch this game again I cant stand that most cosmetics are behind a system of tickets that are hard to come by and RNG that is never in your favor I want to like this game but it hard when they make it completely unfun Played through the  chapter story with  friends I strongly suggest playing with friends as I think it would be incredibly difficult to do by yourself\\n\\nSome chapterslevels were easier than others but we needed a map for chapter  even after playing through it once before\\nThe enemies can feel too powerful sometimes since if they catch you youre dead Thats it Theyre very well done though Theyre beautiful and the animations make them feel alive \\n\\nIts a good game that I feel might need some finishing touches but the core gameplay is solid\\n\\nOverall I can definitely recommend the came especially if you got friends to play with I wish i could play this game again for the first time Side note I think its hilarious people are putting not recommended because they dont think it deserved VR GOTY  Guess what  Any of the year awards are idiotic  Get over yourselves\\n\\nh Okay now for the review h\\n\\nAt first I wasnt a huge fan of the game because Id get lost I have bad sense of direction and be unable to hear my friends  Over time the game grew on me as I learned the enemies and got a system down with the glowsticks  \\n\\nI really quite enjoy it now even if we cheat and chat over Discord while playing  The game can have a lot of hilarious moments and theres plenty of challenge sometimes unfair to keep everyone entertained  Each enemy has unique mechanics to figure out hints are sometimes written on notes in the map and it can make for a lot of tense moments  Also a big fan of any game that has VR support\\n\\nThe devs are also regularly adding in seasonal cosmetics you can find in maps and adding things that are great QoL adjustments  My personal favorite so far is a map that shows you after a match where everyone ran and got knocked outdied in sped up real time  Its so enjoyable to watch except when you realize you missed a cosmetic Dropped thousands of dollars in glow sticks Shidd pants  This was probably the worst coop horror game that Ive ever played Every map and chapter is you walking around at an excruciatingly slow pace to find keys and walking back and forth to objectives you have been to before  times already The maps are so unnecessarily large that you spend almost an hour getting lost in the completely pitch dark map while getting ear blasted by really bad ai The monsters are super boring as well Such a time waster and the story is horrible Voice acting is pretty bad too\\n\\nDont waste ur money hahaha Bro the monsters are after me they are after me they are after me they are after me they are after me they are after me Great game for the money The game finds a way to always keep you on your toes This game is the perfect example of an early access game done right The amount of work this game has undergone is brilliant and adding the random case files has given this game so much fun and playtime as you can see by my playtime Good fun with friends Campaign is good and I enjoyed my time with it  The only thing you have to do is read the other negative reviews and their points then scroll down and read the dev reply that is BOUND to be there The devs dig their own grave with every comment they make and prove every negative review right \\n\\nJoin the discord and watch how each cult member interacts with any person that disagrees with them When teachers pet moderators troll and are allowed to give cute little pepe reactions you would think the devs would reconsider why they made them a moderator in the first place But no they are too precious the devs could never lose their favorite people \\n\\nI hope you like a guilt trip roller coaster too because youll get it in this community Its a blast I absolutely LOVE wasting my time and feeling like I was in the wrong Need I say more Another player shared this dev quote after being literally coerced into changing their review to a positive one theyre not the only one being convinced though The main problem with voicing concerns in steam reviews is that it reduces our store visibility which directly harms us its why I try respond to as many reviews as possible\\n\\nThere was a time when I had fun playing the game with all my friends Now just seeing it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth Check out the game and community Youll see why the negative reviews exist Some of the puzzleslevel layouts can be frustrating but overall its a good game that Ive played with multiple people What a find This is a great game and deserves way more attention than its gotten Fun solo and a blast with friends Maps and monsters are all unique and well crafted You can get lost in the mazes or you can throw down a million glow sticks to help light the traveled paths If you like backroom style games this is a great addition to your library Each time a new map for the story got released my friend and I played through the full story from the start to the new chapter because Labyrinthine just has that much replay ability with the scary and fun monsters to deal with along with the neck cracking puzzles you need to deal with\\n\\n will kill my friend again to sacrifice to the gods Really nice game You can have a lot of fun with your friends Could be lots of fun if you play with other nice sounds and lots of puzzles Its a great combination of puzzle and horror categories Each level is unique and provides different puzzles to solve and places to explore Definitely a mustplay with friends Love to play this game with friends Hoping for new update soon One of the best games around Having been built with so much love and continuing down this journey the devs are incredibly talented and bring a new fear to every map and chapter This game can easily be tons of fun solo but is enhanced even more with the shenanigans of playing with friends pigman Best game ever if you have friends that gets scared easily Felt like Harry Potter in the hedge maz Definitely better with friends I adore this game and I love the constant update of map types monsters and cosmetics that always keep me coming back However I feel bad for my neighbors who have to deal with my screaming anytime I play though Brilliant horror game with an engaging storyline Fun to play with friends but also equally engaging in solo Sound design is also remarkable A spooky game to play with your friends Scary but fun What an amazing game\\nIve played it with a friend and we had such a good time playing it\\n\\nI can recommend it to everyone who likes puzzle games with a bit of horror in it One of my top horror games Its more fun with friends because you can scare them \\nTo my friends please stop bully me Youre scaring me every time TT My friend Bo shit his pants when a pig started to chase him i have not heard him scream so loud before\\n\\nSlow runners make fast runners look good Thank you  From the back of a Tshirt\\n\\n Wonderful game I recommend both case files and the story mode Great game to waste some time with friends on \\nAnxious is my default setting so I am suuuuppper  sensitive to jump scares and tend to avoid games that have them However this game does it juuust enough to startle you but not enough to scare away wimpy players like me great game all around more than worth a try with friends pretty good with friends can be really hard or really easy the story mode is fun and definitely has a difficulty to it The case files are fun and its fun to try and get cosmetics tons of play time tons of funny moments not much grind to have fun with case files Would buy this again Developers stopped the beta just recently but i imagine updates will still come with some frequency despite them wanting to work on another project This game is meant to be played with friends Great laughs and memories were made in this game Not only is it spooky but its also filled with puzzles Grab this game right now if you are looking for something to play with the boys After enjoying all  Still Counting of my hours playing this game I think its finally time for me to write a review Not only does this game offer a story but includes puzzles an amazing community generated mazes exclusive monsters and more Strap in because this one is going to be a long one \\n\\tFirst off the story is quite confusing but dont let that keep you away from getting this game There is lore scattered around you just have to be prepared to find it You go into the maze looking for a missing person and find notes from an officer that went in before you Somebodys running around in the maze and you soon find out there are monsters Its far too late to turn back so you delve further into the maze Each chapter has a unique setup with different themes and new monsters Each monster has a special mechanic that you have to learn through trial and error or by the notes scattered around The story can take up to about  hours if its your first time playing Although this may seem short dont worry because this game isnt all about the story \\n\\tCase files make up what most of the community enjoys Here you can roll for randomly generated cases which will make a maze with a random objectiveOnce you finish the objective you can escape with your life By doing so you can earn Xp and tickets There are some level based cosmetics you can earn while playing these cases There are also cosmetics you can find throughout the cases Some are exclusive to the maps you are playing while some are more common than others Prepare to see lots of caps and visors The thrill of finding every cosmetic is what makes this game so enjoyable for completionists and people looking for a cool outfit to wear Some of the cosmetics are community made too \\n\\tThe community of this game is one of the nicest gaming communities you will ever meet Not only are the devs super interactive with their community but they are always making sure to keep the Valko Discord a safe place In the discord there are always people giving away cosmetics they find and helping each other find things they happen to be missing During Holiday events the discord is super active in finding and giving away cosmetics so definitely good to interact during then\\n\\tIm definitely not going to call this the perfect game its not everybodys cup of tea I find myself taking long breaks from this game and coming back to it It has its fair share of bugs too The devs tend to fix those bugs quite consistently though There are some things that need improvement for example difficult monsters being on difficult maps I think there needs to be a way to make private lobbies and being able to invite people without friending them through steam to prevent kicking of low level players It can be incredibly discouraging to be kicked as soon as you join a lobby since mostly people are in discord talking I think a change of the in game proximity chat would be nice too Perhaps some way to communicate from far away to make it easier to play with people outside of the discord I also wish there was a way to make it easier to tell if a teammate is dead for example a body on the floor or some sort of blood puddle etc etc As of right now its just a floating name Also there is a level  cosmetic that I have yet to reach It is absolutely RIDICULOUS Please end my suffering I blame MEEP  more levels to go though wish me luck \\n\\tThank you so much Devs for being an awesome group and continue to work hard I look forward to your next game PS WICKERMANMASK Tanner Woman Whiskey Man Out Cheap with decent repeatability and lots of collectibles that will keep completionists hooked Seasonal events and updates add to maintain some basic interest While initially scary habituation over playing time turns this game into a relaxing puzzlesolver with an element of danger that is fun to play with friends Recommend This game cures your depression by distracting you with constant anxiety  Great fun if you like Horror and Coop The maps can be huge graphics could use some polishing The monsters are well designed Grab some friends and let the screaming starts D Scary early on but after a few games and knowing the enemies it becomes funnyscary its very loud when you get spotted by certain enemies and stuff but thats just sound mixing issues the goofy animations made it really funny the clowns and the witch had the funniest animations would recommend if you can handle mild scary stuff Story is wacky chapter  is hell but random maps are really fun with friends my friend is mad at me help\\n\\nLabyrinthine is like going for a casual stroll through a maze except the maze hates you and the monsters want a hug I screamed got lost and came out questioning every friendship Ive ever had  would scream in a cornfield again Ay napakasayang laruin parang wala kang problema sa mundo pag nilaro mo to with friends This game has been amazing since I purchased it The team did a fantastic job on the story and all the different puzzles The case files added so my replay value that you can get lost in the game like it was a labyrinth itself You will not regret this purchase Fantastic game Story was fun The case files add a lot of replay value adding new monsters and maps Theres collectibles to find and a small number of cosmetic unlockables as you level up This game is a lot of fun with friends strangers or by yourself I have been tormented by Peppa the Pig and then tormented even more by his insta kill variant I have had many heart attacks due to metal gates slamming and little popout ghosts I have been murdered countless times from my friends and seen the ugliness that is the rat too often BUT I continue playing is this my eternal torment masked as fun I may never know All seriousness the game is  I play it with my friends all the time and it will never fail to make me laugh and die horribly Do buy it lol dear moron im having a swell time here at the insane asylum If youre just like me and end up shting your pants while playing horror games this is it\\n\\nOf course round up some friends so you can scream into someone elses ears as well\\n\\nThank me later At chapter  the game gave the full experience  was fine\\n\\nchapter  killed the fun with the bad map design\\n\\nchapter  introduced bad ending with no choices\\n\\nhalf good half bad As long as they keep adding more content and cosmetics it will always be one of my favorite games Takes awhile to get the hang of it but once you do its a great game  Really fun game I appreciate how much work went into making it Glad I was told to try it out good game if you like getting lost in mazes and killed thousands of times This game has  hours worth of content if you plan on collecting every single bloody cosmetic and i love it Love this game Get to have lots of fun with my friends screaming about how close a monster is or if one of us sent a monster torpedoing at another player Truly a great experience This game will give many hours of fun The vast amount of cosmetics will have you looking to complete your sets Really fun and spooky game that is great solo and with friends Cosmetic hunting in this game is a blast The case files gameplay give the game a lot of replayability for hours and hours of fun One of the best features of this game are the custom case files that you can choose where you go what monsters and how many monsters you face You can make it as easy or as hard as you want My wife and I were looking for a new game to play and stumbled across this as well as two other options but decided to go with Labyrinthine We were both pleasantly surprised at how much enjoyment this game would provide us\\n\\nFirst up the chapters Although weve only completed the first  chapters due to us mostly liking cosmetic hunting we can confidently say that the chapters have been awfully fun to complete Theyre very basic in concept and the story is mostly hidden around the map in the form of tape recordings and notes but it is interesting enough I do understand why some people would find the chapters to be boring as its mostly just walking around with the occasional puzzles but thats the biggest reason Ive found them to be fun Its simplistic and relies a lot on atmosphere\\n\\nNow for the main reason we play Cases These can be accessed at a board and are randomly generated mazes with different sizes and difficulties We absolutely love this mode Although I do understand where some people might not enjoy cases due to it being rather repetitive I dont have an issue with repetitive content and the cosmetic hunting keeps me interested\\n\\nThe amount of tickets and tokens found around the map were an issue for us when we first started playing however with a recent update the amount that were finding has increased so significantly that this is not an issue anymore \\n\\nAnother quick note the mercy system doesnt appear to be great from our experience as were constantly receiving the same exact cosmetics over and over again despite there being a large amount of unique cosmetics in the game Thats my only gripe though\\n\\nI would recommend this game with at least one other friend It isnt bad on solo but its definitely more of an experience that is better played with others its a great and fun game with a wonderful story and many fun cosmetics that you can farm and just enjoy searching for \\nthey also have a great Discord that will help you with anything you need The story mode of this game is pretty good but the case files and the replay value they add is where this game really shines Best played with friends so you can hear their fading screams as they are murdered before your eyes Labyrinthine is a great coop horror game definitely worth the low price especially if you happen to pick it up when its on sale Very fun to play with friends hated the map at first but they fixed it later  I love this game The online repeatable mode is awesome so is the story Really big recommendation especially if gaming with friends Labrinthyne excels in delivering a challenging puzzle experience with diverse mechanics There isnt narration but environmental storytelling instead Despite occasional control issues Labrinthyne is a gem for puzzle enthusiasts offering a unique and visually captivating adventure that stands out One of the best scariest and funniest coop game to play with friends I can recommend this game if you have some friends to play with Some maps are pretty big and you have to solve puzzles Good Atmosphere and enemys who will chase you when they see you Especially Multiplayer they have an infinite live mode very nice of them fun puzzlelost simulator that even has pretty fun vr actual game to get a jumpscare response out of me Graphics\\n Poor Extremely outdated

soundtrack enhances every aspect\\n I really love that once you do the story mode there are so many case files you can complete and theyre all very fun The only thing I wish is that we could have the oil lamp lights for the mines like we used to and could maybe shuffle daily goals Cosmetics are also a little hard to get and I would love if yall got a blonde character Other than that the game is great I really liked it up  until chapter  the game became very long and uninteresting The dragonfly and mine dude literally spawn killed us multiple times The chapter  tile slide puzzle is so fucking annoying with the guy checking on you every  minutes he does multiple rounds and even walks into the little corner where the tile slide is If you like these types of games I recommend until level \\n Great game more of a story than most in this genre alot of fun with friends maps are HUGE chapter  is a bit disappointing tho other than that awesome game Boring story you can barely follow it the only good mazes are the first  ones and maybe the th one the rest is stupid creatures with stupid abilites and stories goofy mosquitos and lazy animation Wouldnt recommend unless ur bored as hell Not too bad definitely not the scariest but a few good jump scares I would recommend playing with a friend I cant see this being super fun solo \\nMazes can get a little tedious for navigation make use of the different coloured glow sticks Super fun game to play with friends case files make the game super replayable  Monsters Creatures and Unknown NoisesOH MY   This game is spectacularly spooky  I cannot believe how much I liked this game  This is so fun to play with a friend  Happy Gaming Love this game lots of replay value Its worth replaying the story mode for the different endings and I caught more about the lore the second and third play through with friends The case files are great fun and there is so much variety I love all of the cosmetics you can find Theyve done a great job with the scares in my opinion they still get me even after all the time Ive played The maps are really beautiful and the monster models are very cool you can tell how much work has gone into the game Just completed story mode with my friends and let me say this ending had us all disappointed\\n\\nLevels  one through four were great Increasing difficulty the lore progressed and made sense left us on the edge of our seats and wanting more  Chapters five and six were massive let downs The maps were huge and made no sense when it came to the story  It went from running through mazes completing puzzles to running around aimlessly in mostly open maps trying  to collect objects  \\n\\nChapter Four is definitely the highlight of the game and it seems to also be where the Devs lost steam when finishing this game \\n\\nI wish the game made more sense after Chapter Four and that there was a proper ending to the game It was more of a cliffhanger than anything I do not see any replayability to this game and the case files just arent worth it  game\\nIf I could play with more than  players then its  This game is both challenging and full of jump scares The jump scares have caused me to soil myself several times  I have Lost sleep while navigating the mazes And my obsession with the game has caused me to miss work My wife says shes taking the kids and leaving me over it I feel this is a pretty good trade off Why is there progression to unlock more case file maps They should all be unlocked at the start this has possibly the best horror game i have ever played just needs more stuff or more story but the best thing i have ever played  would play got this game in  and its still my favorite horror game to this day you will never regret buying it this game is mad fun complete simple objectives while trying to avoid getting killed by a variety of monsters in procedural generated mazes collect cosmetics and level up you can do custom cases where you pick the monsters map type etc hours and hours of fun for a good price highly suggest if you like scary games\\n\\nGAME IS STILL FUN \\n\\nin my opinion they SHOULD add a few new monsters and maps soon I have never been more scared of cardboard ghosts I have also never laughed so hard while watching my friends get ganged by monsters  recommend Spooky and super fun game to play with friend or alone also very developed for a free game\\nThe point of the game is to escape a maze Most mazes require you to complete tasks in order to get out Mainly solving puzzles and finding objects or both\\nEach maze is protected by a different monster Labyrinthine is a game where you run around giant mazes trying to complete objectives while confronting the inhabitants of said mazes Its a very strong entry in the coop horror genre and is best played with friends but there are public lobbies with proximity voice chat for those who have no friends\\n\\nThe story mode is pretty fun with increasingly difficult maps and monsters that will force you to either adapt or die The real meat and potatoes of this game though are the case files randomly generated maps that have a whole slew of new monsters and objectives to keep your synapses firing\\n\\nOn that note there are a TON of monsters and monster variations in in this game all with their own quirks and mechanics to keep track of I dont want to spoil anything too much but just know that if youre playing through the story for the first time you should pay close attention to the notes scattered around the maps some of them may contain clues on how to deal with the monsters that you are currently facing As for the case file monsters you can try figuring out their mechanics through trial and error safe house notes or heading over to the Valko Games Discord they have a lot of information there on monsters maps cosmetics and much more\\n\\nI understand that this game can be hard for some if not most people there are a few especially frustrating situations that can cause players to die over and over again without making any progress long puzzles dead ends and challenging monsters for example So Ive decided to write out a few basic tips in the hopes of encouraging people to not quit on this game when facing these difficulties\\nspoiler\\n Take the time to learn monster information from ingame notes online resources and other people in your lobby\\n Mark dead ends safe houses and other points of interest with differentcolored glow sticks for easier navigation\\n Sound and light have a major impact on enemy detection so if youre trying to hide from a monster then it may be best to turn off your light andor crouch to minimize your chances of being detected\\n If youre running from a monster then try to stay away from the edge of the map as there are many more dead ends on the outside of the map than on the inside\\n If theres a long puzzle arrows memory etc that a monster is camping try having somebody lure the monster away to let other people solve the puzzle in peace\\n There are some monsters that are nearimpossible to get away from without the assistance of items andor a wellplaced safe house so take preventative measures to avoid being detected by those monsters at all\\n Dont spend too much time dawdling in one area as that gives monsters time to converge on your location\\nspoiler\\n\\nThere are a couple of other things to do in the game that I havent written about mostly out of fear that I might be making this review too long so Ill just leave that for the prospective players reading this review to figure out for themselves This really is an amazing game with a wonderful development team behind it and I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes light horror at a great price Scary game a gohst cutout made me scream like a girl  Good story Story chapters are straight forward and a great introduction to the game The puzzles are not too challenging but with monster lurking it adds some difficulty Case files are great for replay value as they randomly generate mazes and have tons of different maps and monsters and tons of cosmetics to randomly find \\n\\nteamSmiley Labyrinthine is a horror game that can be experianced either alone or with a group of friends\\n\\nThe basic premise of the game is to escape a maze Most mazes require you to complete tasks in order to get out Mainly solving puzzles and finding objects or both Once you complete all the tasks you have to find the exit and escape Each maze is protected by a monster or multiple monsters \\n\\nThere is a story mode consisting of  chapters and case files\\n\\nIn case files the map size will vary greatly from very small to giant There are also  difficulty levels that you can choose from Easy normal hard very hard and extreme The number of available lives will vary too\\n\\nCompleting a case file will grant you tickets you can also find extra tickets scattered on the map You can use tickets to buy cosmeticseq\\n\\nThis game remains scary even after Ive played a lot However Its also very fun in coop and it keeps me coming back for more balling game the story levels were cool and unlimited replayablility on the case files but remove chances of getting a dupe cosmetic that fucking sucks hrs of playtime\\n\\nI bought this game with the best intentions  to have an exciting and enjoyable time with a close friend We were both excited to dive into the dark labyrinthine world and face its horrors together However the games intense and suspenseful atmosphere was almost too much for my friend\\n\\n The jump scares are heartstopping It was precisely this immersive and nervewracking environment that made my friend incredibly uncomfortable In fact it proved to be so distressing that it actually made him sick to his stomach leaving him with a lightheaded feeling that was hard to shake off while his hearbeat went aboslutely nuts\\n\\nEven though I personally found Labyrinthine to be a thrilling adventure I couldnt ignore the fact that it was too much for my friend to handle In fact Im unable to muster the courage to play it alone without him now despite my genuine admiration for the game\\n\\nWhile Labyrinthine might not have given us the enjoyable gaming night I had envisioned with my friend I still wholeheartedly recommend it to horror fans It might be too intense for some but its an undeniable testament to the games ability to immerse players in genuine fear and excitement If youre brave enough to confront the horrors within Labyrinthine is a haunting and unforgettable journey into the unknown\\n\\nhrs of playtime\\n Edit So we have now proceeded to play some more Our progress is slow but steady managed to complete up to chapter \\n\\nhrs of playtime\\n We finally finished the game Chapter  were fun alongside the last maze of chapter  the rest is annoying not scary   \\n\\nNow only the bad grind for monsters and maps remains in the custom cases which we will probably skip Definitely worth the investments and can scare you very easily Ive played so many hours on this and still want to keep playing  was shitting my pants Glowsticks was the only thing keeping me sane Spooky Maze game One of the best coop horror games out there imo I have legitimate scares playing Lots of fun with friends Absolutely love playing this game with friends its so much fun Es un juego que se nota que esta hecho en Unity quiero decir el tipo de graficas y varios modelos dentro del juego lo delata Aun asi es un muy divertido juego si conseguis a algun amigo con quien jugarlo\\nExiste dos modos de juego\\n\\nModo Historia como sugiere el nombre se trata de escapar de una serie de laberintos pre armados siguiendo una narrativa a mi parecer un tanto floja pero el viaje es entretenido cada uno de los laberintos con su tematica y giro de tuerca algunos disfrazando el hecho de que son laberintos dentro de sus puzzles\\n\\nModo Casos se tienen  casos para elegir cuya tematica dificultad y tamao se generan de manera aleatoria Dentro de estos el laberinto y sus desafios se generan de manera aleatoria pero con lo que siempre vas a contar es con el hecho de que vas a tener q resolver un puzzle y evitar al monstruo de turno para escapar Dentro de estos casos se pueden encontrar diferentes cosmeticos para personalizar tu personaje y tambien comprar items para ayudarte en las misiones\\nAl completar casos ganaremos experiencia lo que desbloqueara nuevas tematicas para el laberinto monstruos y dificultades\\n\\nEn resumen es un juego divertido que vale la pena probar en lo posible junto a uno o tres amigos No se dejen engaar por sus graficos ADDED EDIT AFTER FINISHING THE GAME \\n\\nWow What an absolute downfall and joke of a story The ending was extremely anticlimactic and made absolutely no sense The lore is poorly explained and it was a huge letdown to follow the story just for an ending that has no explanation Up until chapter four the story and settings made sense but anything after chapter four just seemed like jumbled nonsense Dont waste your money and time figuring out this game if you want a good story\\n\\nIve had this game since early access and while it has come a long way anyone else remember the era of Chapter  being too difficult and spawns not yet reduced so it was literally unplayable and had to get patched I think this game has missed the mark in what it is now trying to achieve\\n\\nI recently came back to the game after full release and am on the final chapter of the story I understand that they are trying to make a game similar to Phasmophobia in terms of replay value however playing the Case Files mode is just not it The currency earned from difficult to achieve dailies is so low in comparison to the amount of currency needed to acquire useful items for case files or cosmetics Not to mention that tickets have to be found inside the Case Files maps never more than  and if the mission fails you do not receive them on top of completing the objective and each Case File can take anywhere from  minutes to complete In addition no experience points or tickets are given for completing the story itself which is very odd to me\\n\\nThe story is GREAT and the game has come a long way since EA but I dont think Ill be touching this game much once the story is completed The riskreward ratio for playing Case Files which barely give currencyexp needing to pay with tickets to play custom matches which requires a TON of unlocking to even create a remotely worth it custom game and the outrageous prices for cosmetics  tickets and usable items just makes the entire Case File game mode worthless Its very frustrating to spend  minutes playing a Case File to receive no tickets and level up maybe once or more if you complete one of the four daily tasks\\n\\nTLDR If youre in it for the story have some friends that will play with you and like being spooked  this game is great The graphics are well done the story has some interesting lore and really cool maps but if youre looking for a game that has replay value I would not recommend this game Overall it is a well done game and I recommend it for the story cool maze mechanics and hilarious moments with friends Proximity chat makes this game a lot of fun too labyrinthine is a fantastic horror game it thrives in combining the multiplayer and horror aspects of games creating an extremely fun yet terrifying experience it was so fun to play with friends and i cant wait to play it again extremely well made  This game is quite a masterpiece I usually have a very hard time sticking to games for long periods of times but this game has truly grasped my full attention I love waking up everyday being able to play this game  great game that genuinely scared me every level unique mechanics for every enemy and captivating environments The atmosphere and the scares are perfect Story mode leaves a lot to be desired but the random map mode has variety and fun for groups Its a bit too hard for solo play but some people are successful I recommend buying this as a spooky game to play with your friends And just avoid any sounds related to metal This game gives me the creeps every time and always makes me jump at least once while I am playing Would anyone perhaps like to befriend me on Steam so I can have someone to solve recreational puzzles with in this versatile horror experience Please DM me if youre interested Dont be shy if youre a Discord Kitten  I dont bite Not gonna lie I was enjoying the game and its gameplay until the very end Chapter  was more annoying then interesting and while Chapter  was okay the ending itself felt like a massive letdown compared to everything weve been through spoiler No joke I spent almost  hours of my life combined minus the many months of waiting for chapters to watch my friend jam a fucking knife in his throat What does that reward us A demon getting its power back then a fade to black Seriously thats it Thats the endingspoiler For  years that was a massive joke for what the payout was\\n\\nI wont lie My friends and I played through the Story Mode primarily not really much of the Case Files We dabbled a bit but that was when the Case Files only used the monsters from the Story Mode So the game might be worth it for the replayability that it can give you but I highly doubt it will last very long even if each map is randomly generated\\nAt most I would suggest grabbing it on a sale if it goes on sale\\n\\nAnd to avoid any real disappointment Id suggest mainly playing just the Case Files if you do buy it Cause the story will disappoint you Heavily This game is truly amazing for it being in development for so long The maze aspect is a refreshing change The game isnt that in depth with mechanics or detail but its good If you have issues with not getting the game to load just reinstall This is a great game with lots of challenges However the only reason I give this a bad review in the end is my team got to one of the last parts of the game in the mines where the skull puzzle is We could not get the door to open automatically as we were able to arrange the discs correctly but the door stayed shut preventing us from moving forward can not have sex with ancient symbol man good game though Surprisingly this game is great fun and pretty spooky Ive enjoyed both the story mode as well as the case files especially when played with friends The atmosphere is generally done really well though most of the scares absolutely come from jump scares when the monster sees you and roars or screeches or whatever Each monster is unique and has a different tactic you need to take to deal with them or sneak by or escape them which is great fun especially since you usually get little clues left on scraps of paper that provide hints about the monsters youre dealing with\\n\\nMy only complaint about this game thus far is the approach they took to unlocking new areas to play in for the case files The random ones I get are almost always the corn maze or the forest with a rare sprinkling in of other ones has a really good story line however the repeatable content isnt really up to what the story was like Really hope for new chapters to come out D This game was so much fun with friends I recommend playing this and getting the scare out of everyone PS kiss the insecure boogie man on the forehead he needs it WARNING not for fault heart\\nme and my friend so stressful and lot of fun\\nglowstick is your best friend\\nChapter  are brutal\\nits worth it if you enjoying puzzle survival and maze Great game I played it around  years ago when it was in its early state Now that it has been released recently many bugy were fixed the game got polished and the last chapter was added\\nFor a price like this I can really recommend this game This game is genuinely terrifying Its incredibly good at making you feel anxious I play a fair bit of horror games this is the first that has scared the shit out of me its even worse when you unlock a new map and dont know what to expect fuck the marionette Edit also fuck smiley that mf can burn for eternity hes broken asshole molested me  times in the span of  minutes I didnt even move\\n\\n good game with friends amazing game i loved it a lot and streamed this game a lot its fun playing with friends Very good game the chapters is amazing its also very fun to play case files with youre friends and alone A really immersive puzzle game wrapped in a maze you gotta navigate Because of this alone its challenging for me as my memory for directions is poor but this made it fun instead of frustrating haha That coupled with the fact there is possibly something bumping in the dark that will make you regret foolishly running into a corridor or room makes this game a gem to cherish Story was complete in hrs total playtime casually but the real bulk of the game is really in the optional stuff which i love in games I would say a solid  I loved the entire game it really was worth the time put in the creators did an amazing job A very fun and scary game I highly recommend playing with friends\\n\\nEdit I did have an issue with save file syncing This was not the devs fault It was a Steam issue It ended up messing up my save and I lost a few items In the discord one of the devs was able to help me out and get my stuff back to me That is something that wouldnt happen with a big game company A big company either wouldnt respond or wouldnt care Once again Thanks so much for the help And keep doing what youre doing Me and my friend have been playing this game for well over a year and we have had fun times confusing times but most importantly times we needed a new set of pants  you will shit yourself More than worth it A really fun coop horror game that I keep coming back to Im not a fan of horror but exploring the mazes especially with case files is a lot of fun with friends \\n\\nJust finished chapter  with a friend and the story is alright not amazing just fine Its mainly the enemy variety and set pieces that are good in the story mode Then its case files which I plan to beat every map \\n\\nGreat game highly recommend it if youve got friends to play it with Really fun game to play with friends Scary and funny  Played this game with some friends really good puzzle game sprinkled with jump scares and horrors The puzzles arent too hard nor are they too easy Definitely makes you think though I love the replayability with the case files Personally I think there could be a few more avatar choices as well as avatar graphics updates but thats a small gripe \\nCant wait for more chapters to come out\\nps glowsticks are your best friend\\n its a great multi player game that never gets old due to the daily challenges and the randomly generated maps this game is beautifully done and so addictive  love it\\n Game very gord plz get and give these people money to make more gud stuff me likey I hate horror games but this game is extremely fun with friends so take it from a guy who hates horror games this game is fun as hell and I highly recommend this game humana humana humana humana humana humana humana humana humana humana humana Played this game with my mates the story is genuinely so good some cheap scares but theyre funny Seeing your mate die over and over doesnt ever get not funny God level game to play with the lads Good puzzle solving and hidden tasks that arent over the top annoying to solve Blind guessing is sometimes the way to go Definitely Get this game if you want to play a semi long game with the boys if you want story Or you can play the case files that are generated and theyre pretty good too Not as fun as the main story but still cool Not the scariest in actual terms of horror but running away from a monster to a dead end can still get your heart racing Hoping for more games like this from the devs Would buy them in a heart beat I convinced the boys to get it while it was on sale just cause it was a good price but honestly would play like xx taht if i knew it was this good Cant wait to see what these guys do for this game next or for another one great game especially for  wish there was more really liked the atmosphere that the game created on each level Got about  hours of game play out of the story  would happily pay  upwards of  dollars for the story alone would recommend that you play with friendsif you have any and make sure you use in game voice chat as it ups the experience to another level my friends and i made the mistake of using discord for the first level \\n\\nspoiler warning \\n\\n\\n\\nonly complaint is that the miner spawns to frequently you will walk away and he will spawn again in front of you like what de fuk Was a great game to play with mates had a great time with the puzzles and working out each monsters gimic that you could use to beat them  hoping for sequel glowsticks were amazing aswell honestly fuck joan she a hoe \\nlove the glowsticks tho Very fun and scary game that feels like it has a really good replayability due to the case file section of the game Would definitely recommend definitely worth the price This game truly is so fun to play with friends You can tell that the development team put a lot of work into making this an enjoyable experience and I cant wait to see what they do next Truly a great game to play with friends We never not have a ton of laughs Gotta use proximity chat Grab a duo or a squad for this one Play with the VOIP on without any rd party comms One of the best multiplayer horror escape games ever to exist Puzzles are challenging with an added constant pressure of being stalked by mysterious entities Made a bunch of memories with friends If horror themed campaign games with coop are your cup of tea this is a nobrainer I hope they come out with a sequel or something similar to this soon Walk around corner\\nSee Monster\\nDont tell your friend\\nWatch your friend as he does a  panic jumps and gets absolutely annihilated\\nRun away screaming and laughing\\nrepeat I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of Labyrinthine on Steam not long ago and I must say it was an exhilarating adventure from beginning to end Speaking as a seasoned gamer I can assure you that this game offers a truly distinctive and utterly captivating experience\\n\\nAs I first bought this game I had several doubts about if the game was worth the money that I spent but let me assure you it was\\n\\nThe atmosphere within Labyrinthine is truly exceptional The very instant I set foot within the eerie desolate mansion an aura of tension enveloped me The developers have executed a remarkable job in crafting an incredibly immersive and spinetingling setting The dimly lit corridors eerie sounds and subtle visual hints all coalesce to establish an ambiance that keeps you enthralled and on edge throughout the entire gaming experience \\n\\nNot only does the game offer simple but effective mechanics but also the sound and visuals are just remarkable The attention to detail in the environment and the eerie soundtrack contribute significantly to the overall immersion The game runs soooooo smoothly and although I encountered some technical issues during my playthrough the developers were fast to patch them the next week\\n\\nI would say that Labyrinthine for sure is a Steam game that deserves more recognition It successfully combines a spinechilling atmosphere engaging storytelling clever puzzles and multiplayer excitement into one unforgettable package If youre a fan of horror games that keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat Labyrinthine is an absolute mustplay game\\n\\nI wish there was more chapters to the story but I cannot complain how well done the story is I cant wait to see what the next update is gonna be about D Do you want me to pay for a glowstick recolor Really This game is simply amazing The fact that its so cheap blows my mind Please continue to make quality games like Labyrinthine Great game with friends but can get boring and repetitive on your own One of the best horror games for the price Recommend playing with a group of friends when i bought it i was ready to refund it before playing less than an hour but before i realized i had already played  hours straight with people at my level who were also new to the game we had a lot of fun after in the first chapter so we kept going  this game is pure skills  which you learn while playing like making quick decisions in short period of times and adapt to the surroundings what ever the map it also has a Back rooms map when you reach level  which is really fun to play with friend So i would recommend  to buy this game if youre into horror puzzle games you also have to learn about the creatures in the game like SCP GAMES  ATTENTION     SCP   ATTENTION \\nSHY GUYS BROTHER IS IN THE GAME Love it Best to play with friends a little boring solo It was a beautiful morning i woke up ate breakfast and went to buy some new clothes I found very nice red leather pants that cost me around  then i went home My friend send me a message in discord We play now I join my friend with my new red leather pants and buy this game for  We play the game it was fun until the pig level I saw pig i shit pants This game cost me my sanity and my  red leather pants  would recommend The only thing worse than this game is how bad my brother is at playing it This is probably my favourite game to just chill out with friends on With all the different maps types and interesting monsters all with their own mechanics it is infinitely replayable The two years leading up to leaving early access saw constant sizeable updates and you can really tell the devs care about this game\\n\\nFor me buying the supporter DLC day one was no question Super fun creepy maze game It has two distinct parts to it The main game has a loose story that takes you through six handcrafted levels with lots of monsters and puzzles The main story plays best with friends The case files are an independent set of experiences where you have to find your way through procedurally generated maps with randomly selected monsters and difficulty So theres lots of replayability even after finishing the main game as the case files increase in difficulty and unlock new maze types and monsters A lot of love went into this game and Ive played it through from the early Early Access to release Worth every cent A very fun coop game with an amazing community The dev team makes sure to stay on top of things and address any issuesfeedback provided within a short frame Absolutely recommend This game is so much fun to play with friends in game chat especially when you hear them scream in horror off in the distance being chased I LOVE THIS GAME love playing with friends and finding cosmetics the maps being different every time keeps it fun D\\n\\nstory is not that special imo but i loved chapters  and  the randomised cases are where its at whether u play on an easier difficulty or want to shit urself on hardcore this game is lots of fun with friends and strangers alike   theres items ingame that can make u run fast or make a point of interest for the compass and the different monsters have their own mechanics that may take a bit to figure out \\n\\ndef give it a try and if ure review bombing bc of VR GOTY then i think u might desperately need some good vibes in ur life lol Nice fun little game for a pretty solid price Game is fun and best enjoyed with friends that like to scream and panic The multiplayer experience is the major selling point of the game Kudos to the sound design though really solid\\n\\nThe chapters while the earlier ones are supposed to be undergoing some small renovations to improve the experience are the most enjoyable aspect of the game They are tailor made experiences that balance the horror aspect with the exploration and are full of content to keep people engaged with story clues and so forth\\n\\nThe case files are fun replayable content They can get repetitive or stale after a bit but will definitely help you stretch your play time out a bit to get more game time per dollar There are several case file only monsters puzzles and map types that help provide additional content beyond the story mode as well\\n\\nChapters are unlocked in sequence with certain chapters being more engaging than others but overall a fun experience Case files are locked behind a level system that allows the player to access more content as they play the case files more It can be a little slow for some newer players but as you level up you get access to new monsters and map types\\n\\nSome monsters maps puzzles etc are easily better than others but the quality is relatively consistent across the board and there isnt anything egregiously out of place or not fun Some puzzles or map objectives can veer in the realm of unsatisfying though Would definitely have been improved to allow some more cross map monsterobjectivepuzzle types for further variety as certain monsters puzzles and objectives will only show up on certain maps \\n\\nThe devs are pretty chill and usually pretty responsive currently as well in the games Discord\\n\\nOverall not a perfect experience but very enjoyable especially for its price Good little bonding experience for you and your friends  A steal of a deal for  I absolutely recommend this game Its a lot of fun and doesnt feel repetitive in the slightest Plus the dev team are amazing They are always quick with responses to questions and you can tell how much love they have poured into this game \\n\\nI am surprised by just how much I have enjoyed it Just hold on tight to that flashlight when the pig is nearby Game is great with friends been playing for about a year now and i never seem to get bored of it the chapters are really good but the case files and the cosmetic hunting is arguable the funnest part \\nI would say for the price of the game it is  worth it An incredibly underrated coop horror game Its a ton of fun to play with friends and there is a lot of replayability The campaign is also well done giving you a slightly different challenge from the randomized case files Definitely worth picking up if youre a fan of horror games great game the campaign was fun and had a decent amount of content the case files are the real deal tho they add a ton of replayability to the game and all the cosmetics are really fun to collect Fun Game\\n\\nCasefiles a buggy shit show at times due to rng and why am i with decent connection and pretty good hardware freezing hardcore for split seconds Like thats what kills me more than anything Until its more stable i cannot recommend it at all\\n\\nffxv no issues Hogwarts Legacy no issues Smite no issues fucking Diablo  no issues but this game this game lags like a hotdog going down a blender Labyrinthine is a really fun game with friends been playing it since there was essentially  level Ive had many funny moments and the monsters are genuinely pretty scary and theres still more to do even after you complete the main story with different monsters to torment you If you have friends its a pretty solid experience Itll get you to jump and shout from time to time depending on how focused you are but overall the game has a lot of content for you to go through and enjoy Every map will be different except for the story but overall not a bad time Absolutely love this game so far The storyline has been wonderful and I can not wait for it to continue growing and changing over time Probably my favorite coop horror game\\n\\nCurrently Ive just been playing with my wife the laughs the screams the frustrations this game is an emotional roller coaster and I love it Im very excited to play coop with  players at some point\\n\\nNow as for content the story is a bit mid just see it as a introductiontutorial to the game act  were okay  oof\\n\\nThe real content is Case Files which are randomly generated maps where this game shines is the amount of monsters and how they behave different from each other the amount of unique puzzles the different map aesthetics\\nThe game also has cosmetics and even Hardcore Case Files with unique cosmetics I got devil horns the other day\\nHardcore Case Files are you die youre dead once you fail the Case File also gets removed from the Case Board\\n\\nFinal Verdict\\nI highly recommend this game\\nAs with all horror games its best to be played with friends the core game is simple Do Puzzles and Escape the Maze but it works\\n Ive spent many hours playing this game and will play many more I love how the dev team actually listens to the community with constructive criticism and finds new ways to make the game better for us I enjoy playing the custom cases with friends with all the scares and fun I also hope to see more story chapters in the future The only con that Ive had with this game is that I cant play the story mode for the first time again but thats nothing wrong on the devs side I would highly recommend this game if youre looking for something new Got many many hours and still get jump scared plenty of replay with custom generated labyrinths Worth every penny even at full price Devs are very responsive with an active discord very fun  super scary i play with my friend and we never get bored bc all the new maps you can unlock and new killers love the custom cases so after we unlock a map we go explore it with no monsters cant wait to see more maps and updates A really fun time especially with a group of friends pretty much all the maps are great on the case files and the monsters are pretty cool too Give it a solid  definitely recommend Amazing Horror game thats definitely under priced Has more content than most AAA games for a fraction of the price Honestly one of the best puzzle  horror games i have played hoping new content to come even more I do  percent recommend this game This is a fun multiplayer horror game When getting this game do yourself a favor and join their discord because they have a great community The devs are very passionate about the game They spent so much time on it and it shows  \\n\\nThis game has a story mode also case files In the case files you can collect cosmetics which can be addicting hence why i have so many hours in this game I hope you guys enjoy  Actual dev quotes\\n\\nThe main problem with voicing concerns in steam reviews is that it reduces our store visibility which directly harms us its why I try respond to as many reviews as possible\\n\\nWe talked about it in a dev blog before but every negative review takes  positives to counter which sucks Weve been as high as  positive and as low as  positive Were currently climbing back up now at  positive\\n\\nJoin the discord get guilt tripped leave a positive review instead\\n\\n dont buy the game for the chapter they kinda here to be a tutorial get some friends with u and play the online cases thats where the fun begin Labyrinthine was an absolute gem of a game I played ut with a group of friends and we had a blast I was absolutely hooked when we first played its a dark and and immersive world \\n\\nThe attention to detail in the game is remarkable with a bunch of puzzles ofc the gameplay is both challenging and exhilarating it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the game \\n\\nThe game beautifully weaves a haunting narrative that unfolds as you progress leaving me eager to uncover the mysteries lurking within the labyrinths depths This game is so much fun If you like being scared and puzzles and like listening to your friends freak out as they get chased by monsters too then this is the game for you The growing number of map and monster types and random generation keep things from getting stale The mix of mechanics are simple but interesting Chapter  is the worst thing Ive ever played god please turn the lights and brightness back up and make the maze less of something a  year old with crayola magic marker mapped out Fun for the price point has some genuinely good scares and great atmosphere case files give some decent replayability and looking forward to future updates The atmosphere is so great The puzzles are fun the monster desgins are amazing Ive loved the game since very early devlopement  would recommend to horror fans If you can leave a trail of glowsticks  follow it back this game is a must update i played through story mode a second time just because i was playing it with another friend i still dont recommend it and i think its pretty uncool of these devs to ask groups of people not to each leave a review because it can give the wrong impression  dev update if four different people play the game and they each dont like it then they can each leave a negative review if they so choose\\nwhat really gives the wrong impression of a game is it having a generally positive rating but only because youve discouraged people from leaving negative reviews\\n\\n i enjoyed the game but probably only because i played with a friend its a really tedious game for such an underwhelming ending\\nthe first two chapters were pretty fun but it kinda got boring from there\\ni generally do not recommend this game to others sorry\\nonly played story mode Game is really good and fun Easy to waste insane amount of time just running through the mazes Great stories and plenty of cosmetics to keep running to get The more friend the better Definitely Suggest customizing a case for a Large Map with max monsters ect if you really want to laugh and have a good time with a party of people Story is really good Cant wait to see it keep growing I spent  hours trying to finish chapter  but the spider is always on top of me so I just cant beat it Really fun game First  maps were the best  and  were just as fun even though you could get lost easily in  I personally disliked map  the most It was way to chaotic and even after an update saying it was made more linear it really wasnt Getting away from the creatures was difficult and a little annoying but for me and friend still worth it The mines mapmap  was kinda hard but better than  imo BUT the addition of a giant spider is just INCREDIBLY unnecessary and such a d move for me at least because I now have to sit here and listen to my friend play it alone because I have severe arachnophobia So yeah thats utter trash \\n\\nOverall I do recommend but MAJOR ammendments on the spider BS are in order Developers are still adding stuff regularly so repeatability has been satisfying and introducing friends to the campaign since the last chapter has been added had been a delight The enemies teleport to you in the most recent level while doing the puzzle which makes it impossible except if you have a friend that loops the enemy This game scawy fo me my good buddy XzigPlaysGames told me this was a dating simulator and it wasnt lets just say that he is no longer my friend If being a masochistic maze connoisseur sounds like your thing\\nLabyrinthine has you covered great multiplayer to play with friends involves using teamwork to get through mazes Can be quite scary at times lol I love it I feel like this is much better playing with friends over randoms The chapters are great but the case files is where the addiction began The constant hunt for cosmetics is what drives this game If you have a love for collecting things then this will suck you in The monsters are challenging without being too over the top With practice and paying attention you learn their mechanics and learn very quickly how to counteract the I am absolutely in love with this game and look forward to all the new updates and additions coming our way  Great game Still in development so it has a few bugs but is steadily getting better Active community and discord Easy to report bugs and give feedback\\n\\nReally good AI and mechanics Good puzzles great underlying story Tonnes of fun For those of you that like Subliminal STALKER METRO or other horror games this is a must have\\n  love this game I always recommend this game when people ask for games to play Even after playing for hours over  hours at the time of typing this i STILL get scared scream and panic Honestly this is ok at best and tedious at worst  The mazes were unintuitive a lot of the time We spent so much time wandering around lost and backtracking even when we used our glowsticks and compasses Monsters supposedly had tricks to be avoided but half the time didnt work especially in the first couple areas I played with friends and the social aspect was the only fun part We finished all six chapters I dont regret it because it was a good way to hang out with people but I uninstalled the game immediately afterwards No desire to play the individual cases\\n\\nA pro though  chapter  was stellar One of the spookiest haunted houses Ive explored and the first time Wickerman screamed at me I nearly shit myself Chapter  is  everything else not so much there was really little incentive for story mode but now you cant even wear cosmetics why even have it in the first place when you want people to do case files Pissed shart and came my pants I hate this game its amazing\\n\\n would play again its terrifying\\n\\nWitch is low key kinda hot but dislikes my advances Who ever designed that weird lanky circus jester i hate you fr you ruined my day very scary but i hope you step on a lego im literally writing this in a safe house while this woman is tweaking and taking her head off in front of me\\n\\nI want nothing more than for you to drink a hot tea and it burns your tongue This is Seriously one of the Best games ive played i mean yes it can drag on when you have been in a maze for a while  but Honestly no matter what the panic will set in when a monster jumps you and your running for your life then get jump scared by a random Ghost in the trees  lol cause we all know this has happened to us   Also this game allows people with Low end PCs to play  one of my very close friends who i love to play with does not have a very good pc but is able to play this game  yes she plays on Potato  but it runs well and she doesnt get booted or have lag problems Honestly just an all around fun game I really suggest it to everyone i speak to  best intro to multi player survival Horror especially for long time players cause its relaxed enough you can zone out to it  but also intense enough you get the thrill you want from the genre Most fun Ive had with a survival horror The devs do a great job maintaining and updating this game and the maps and monsters are both fun scary and atmospheric Out of the big survival horror coops this one stands out with its cosmetic drops that turn you into a hunter yourself in these mazes looking for fun things to wear or the best part changing your glowstick shape It just feels more rewarding when you can leave a map with a new treasure even if its something silly like a cowboy hat The story mode is great too gameplay wise with its moments of shaking things up with various tasks or puzzles Theres also a real sense of accomplishment there when youve figured out how to progress to a different area and moving forward is satisfying The game had an amazing and honest start The levels made sense in relation to each other the monsters were genuinely scary and the levels were beatable solo if need be It seems the more you play the more it seems to become dependent on having friends to play with Granted I had friends to play with the entire time but if someone likes solo horror games then I would not recommend this The levels got worse with each update The levels used to be short and sweet and entertaining Here lately ESPECIALLY the last level they seemed to have focused more on creating massive mazes where it seems next to impossible to survive the entire maze in one life The levels have just progressively lost value It sucks because we had a group of people who closely watched when levels got released just to be disappointed by the state of the game To me unless I wasnt following along the story was absolute dogwater It made sense in the beginning but the levels made less and less sense and the story was less and less interesting Maybe the devs will  the direction they headed and Ill give the game another chance otherwise Ive done all I want to do in this game and simply cannot enjoy it enough to recommend someone else to play it Friends and I have played pretty much every horror coop survival game you can on the PC and this one is easily one of the best if not the best Once you get the learning curve down its super addicting Good game its terrifying and I really like how it goes through many aspects and archetypes of American horror many of which have nothing to do with one another Really REALLY fun in multiplayer would recommend to play with friends Never done a review before but this game ticks my boxes its fun with friends and other developers should take note on how to make a game lol Really interesting horror game The story was very fun and the puzzles were fresh and unique enough to keep me engaged until I finished it Ive since been playing the cases with friends and its just as enjoyable especially as you level up and harder cases show up This game was outstanding in every way The game itself consumed quite a bit of my time but it was well worth it I completed all the games achievements all of which were extremely challenging The only thing that I found disappointing was that I couldnt complete the backrooms level in cooperative play i had never played this game until over a month ago me and a few others never played anything like this and let me tell you this my heart never stop beating this game had us on our toes until we beat it ton of fun with friends the story is whatever but the case files are a blast Dont expect good cosmetics though lol Ive waited a long time for this game to come to a conclusion Absolutely  recommend you grab a few buddies get absolutely obliterated on your substance of choice and only use proximity chat to fully enjoy these mazes The shock factor of encountering the new and unique enemies was extremely memorable This was a oneanddone type of game for me but with nearly  hours in I would say this was  worth it Do yourself a favor and give this a go Well done One of the best horror games currently on the market especially for the price  Story mode is pretty good after they redid it and the random cases mode is super fun and scary  Made by what is most definitely the best game studio Valko I have seen in a very long time they are constantly taking player feedback and implementing it into the game  \\n worth the price buy it now Soft recommend Was a pretty fun ride up until the last chapter and devs fail to listen to a lot of feedback They constantly try to sidestep that the ai in the game is pretty poor and some of the monsterschapters are just downright not fun to play They also have an extra gamemode called case files but you have to grind a bit to unlock all of the levels which I dont really care to do because the earlier levels you have access to are pretty boring to play through All in all me and a buddy had fun playing through but man this game could really have been better Nice game good chases some sounds are a bit loud but its a horror game so its kinda essential I guess Its worth the money and doesnt get boring even after playing for a bit Labyrinthine is a game the comes along once every  years You will not be disappointed and it well worth the price The game takes about  hours to beat Solo and a little faster if you use a premade group One of the best horror games out there Labyrinthine is an absolute gem of a game that delivers a thrilling and immersive experience like no other From the moment I delved into its dark and foreboding underground world I was hooked The attention to detail and atmospheric design truly set it apart from other horror games on the market at this price\\n\\nThe gameplay mechanics in Labyrinthine are incredibly wellcrafted providing a perfect balance between heartpounding suspense and strategic gameplay As a survivor the tension of exploring the labyrinth solving intricate puzzles and evading the Dwellers relentless pursuit kept me on the edge of my seat Every step I took felt consequential and the sense of accomplishment upon solving a puzzle and progressing further was immensely satisfying\\n\\nThe multiplayer aspect of Labyrinthine adds an extra layer of excitement Collaborating with friends to overcome the challenges and navigate the labyrinth together enhances the immersion and makes every encounter with the Dweller even more exhilarating The coordination required between team members creates a sense of camaraderie that truly elevates the gameplay experience\\n\\nThe graphics and sound design in Labyrinthine are topnotch The detailed environments and atmospheric lighting bring the labyrinth to life immersing players in a hauntingly beautiful and terrifying world The sound effects from the echoing footsteps to the distant whispers contribute to an atmosphere that constantly keeps you on edge The combination of these elements creates an immersive experience that will have you engrossed from start to finish\\n\\nFurthermore the developers commitment to the game is commendable Regular updates and additions have enhanced the gameplay and addressed any issues showing a dedication to providing players with the best possible experience The supportive community and the developers responsiveness to feedback further contribute to the games overall appeal\\n\\nIn conclusion Labyrinthine is an absolute blast to play Its immersive gameplay tense atmosphere and multiplayer dynamics make it a standout horror game that will keep you entertained for hours on end If youre a fan of horror or multiplayer games Labyrinthine is an absolute mustplay Prepare yourself for an adrenalinefueled journey through the labyrinth where every corner holds the promise of terror and triumph  A GREAT GAME love this game me and my buddy had a blast we just finshed the last chapter very sad but definitly buy Really fun concept with replayability for cosmetic hunting Lots of room to grow still but a good game Hopefully they just add tons and tons of fun cosmetics in the future After hitting the h mark I think it is finally time for me to review this game\\nRule No  Dont play this alone because it takes away so much from the experience this game delivers  players is best\\nRule No  Dont rush the story Take your time to explore the maps and read the notes youll find you wont understand the story otherwise The notes also keep important information about the monsters youll encounter and their backstory\\n\\nWhilst I can understand the reviews that slander the main story to a certain point we finished the game and looked back at the beginning  how tf did we get here the game sure does not deserve that many negative reviews\\nEvery monster you encounter has its own mechanic and you will have to find out The atmosphere is fantastic and after all this time still gets me scared Its also obnoxiously loud love those Wickerman screams directly into my soul After youve finished the main story you can go into the case files for random mazes with different difficulties and sizes who invented the giant maps We need to have a talk I wholeheartedly recommend this game\\n\\nPlus points for this masterpiece of a song during the credits The Maze by Tamsin It sooooo good The game is SO DAMN LOUD My friend and I were just finishing up the catacombs without dying once until we turned the corner and the LOUDEST pig screech ever greets us as we both die  this game continues to terrify me alone and with friends The story is amazing but I am really looking forward to another chapter\\n\\nEdit Here is a more comprehensive list of things I enjoy and dont enjoy\\nLikes\\n added industrial flashlight which is super bright\\n the story is replayable quite a few times Ive played the catacombs no less than  times\\n reworked the sound system so it is less deafening\\n\\nDislikes\\n seems like they are pushing  monsters on each case and sometimes they are unplayable\\n you have to open the game and be at the start menu otherwise the invitation to lobby wont work minor bug\\n\\nAs a whole this game is amazing and if you coordinate with your usual group of friends everyone can buy a different glow stick cosmetic in the shop Fun spooky game to play with friends It can only get better from here\\n\\nPS Miner guy do be lookin kinda good though Incredible Horror game  amazing experience all round\\n\\nEvery single chapter was amazing except chapter  which was a little disappointing Chapter  was by far the scariest experience I had with the game  chapter  gave many of the same scares\\n\\nThe case files give a great opportunity for replayability with different size maps  cosmetics for a quick scare\\n\\nFantastic experience Game is great fun with friends and has a good bit of replayability with multiple endings for the main chapters and cosmetic collecting for the cases  There are a TON of cosmetics to collect  My group always enjoys going in and doing cases for cosmetics\\n\\nAdditionally the dev team is fantastic  They communicate frequently and help out players in their discord i hope they keep bringing out chapters because i dont want it to end One of the most fun horror games on Steam IMO The replayability is great with the randomly generated cases story mode is fun up until the last mission and Ive damn near browned myself a handful of times playing it Sometimes you get spawn camped by the monster but you just have to wait it out a minute People in matchmaking are either the nicest people you met or their mic catches EVERY sound possible and they lure the monster to you on accident Also it has backrooms This game is fun as fuck The case files add a whole other level of fun and challenges outside of story mode Finding cosmetics with my friends has been a great time Am excited for the upcoming additions Well done on this game guys Cant wait for all the new stuff Very fun story and the case files are endless fun with constant changing maps I dont review games often but Labyrinthine is truly something special It absolutely nails coop horror to a wonderful degree alternating between being fun and terrifying in equal measure The game has an insane amount of content to explore and the devs constantly deliver wonderful updates I cant recommend it enough If youre seeking a game to thrill\\nLabyrinthine can fit the bill\\nBut Chapter six you must beware\\nFor it might cause you to despair\\n\\nThe puzzles that once gave a chill\\nBecome boring lacking thrill\\nThe scares that once made you whimper\\nFall flat with little glimmer\\n\\nIts a pity this final note\\nAfter hours spent to devote\\nBut do not let it ruin the fun\\nThe game is well crafted bar none\\n\\nLabyrinthines atmosphere is grim\\nBut throughout it keeps you in\\nThe tension builds with every stride\\nYou feel your fears start to collide\\n\\nSo if youre seeking a game to play\\nLabyrinthine might make your day\\nJust be aware of chapter six\\nAnd dont let it spoil the mix I really like this game However chapter  has a mob that puppy guards a puzzle Making the game unplayable and annoying Labyrinthine is a damn good game In theory a game where you traverse the same mazes over and over would seem like a boring concept or get old quick This game manages to do the opposite You can expect something new every time you enter the maze A new assortment of monsters a new puzzle and a new randomized map When I first started this game I had no idea what I was doing I finally figured out the mechanics of listening to the music and your surroundings and it changed the game With the launch of Chapter  this game achieved a new level of cool It answered so many questions ending was perfect and the end credits song was fire This game also managed to get me obsessed with the backrooms genre via the secret backrooms map \\n\\nAll and all my experience with this game is always a  and I hope it continues to get updated well in the future \\n\\n\\n had a tone of fun playing this with a group of friends loved the constant flow of content as it kept us coming back with every update weve came a long way to see the finale clearly made by a passionate team of devs You can do Brixton to your homie in the final section of Chapter   Whatsup guys unfortunately the problem with this game is again and again that things are not thought through to the end The best was and is the hedge maze After that the game has high points from time to time but continues to degrade Unfortunately the last part is a disaster Too dark no way to escape the monster or find your way around I have the feeling that Chapter  was released unfinished and not thought through Very sad the ideas are partly very good but it lacks depth again and again I hope this will be worked on again Single player was decent entertainment add friends and it can be great time\\nThe plot is pretty much background and mostly just instructions on how to solve whatever puzzle or challenge you are up again wrapped up in a little bit of I was here first and this is how I did it language The single player maps are interesting and the background plot has some interesting lore but some of the puzzles can get horrifically repetitive find X items hidden throughout the map to open some gate By and large it can be a good experience as having to be constantly vigilant for monsters and find ways to backtrack to avoid them really enhances the horror aspect\\n\\nUnfortunately there is probably only about  hours of single player content even accounting for the ever present scavenger hunts So after you go through the story chapters all that is left is multiplayer\\n\\nSadly the biggest negative with this game is that multiplayer is horrible it is straight up grinding so you can grind\\nThe objective of multiplayer is cosmetics which are very rare on a normal map or guaranteed on a rare map These maps also differ in difficulty size and location The obvious take away here is that if you want to complete your collection of cosmetics you want to spend as much time on rare maps and as little time on nonrare or large maps which can take a very long time to complete\\n\\nRare maps are exactly as described on the tin rare but there is a way to get them more frequently Completing a map will grant experience which does nothing and tickets which can be used in a store to buy some minor items Of these items only two are really worth purchasing the revival bracer which will allow you to self revive once a few seconds after dying so better hope the monster wandered off or youll just die again and the reroll token which can regenerate a single map for you The latter is the mechanism through which you can increase the number of rare maps you play thus increase the number of cosmetics you encounter\\n\\nSo most of the time you are grinding maps to earn tickets Those tickets are then used to purchase reroll tokens which are used to reroll maps in the hopes of getting a rare map with a cosmetic or to get rid of the ever so common very large extreme difficulty maps This process consumes MANY tokens which take a while to get And after all of that when you do finally get a rare map there is no guarantee that cosmetic one of  or so isnt one you dont already have Some cosmetics are incredibly common looking at you plaid hat others incredibly rare So if completing the cosmetics is your goal buckle up for hundreds of hours of grinding Ive really enjoyed playing the game with friends and watching the game grow with them has been a lot of fun I would recommend the game for anyone that wants a good scare or just some possible dumb fun with friends  I have been playing this since launch with a group of friends and it has been a blast Genuinely one of my favorite multiplayer experiences Even for a early access game it has been a blast We get really excited when new content is released and the Developers are VERY good with communication and engaging with the player base Its been so refreshing to play and work through a game that the creators obviously care a lot about and are open to opinionscritiquesetc and truly just want to make the best experience they can If youre into to puzzle solving and horror games this a perfect game for you Fantastic game got in there early days in So much communication from the developer This game brought me and my partner together Very inspiring to see independent companies make such incredible games in such a short span of time Looking forward to future projects  The devs are constantly listening to their player base and making positive changes Unfortunately some people are quick to judge and be very harsh but I have had fun with all the chapters in this game My dad and I finish them together We also hunt for cosmetics during events and drop rates etc have improved for those as well Highly recommend if you enjoy puzzles and jump scares The number of times Ive thrown my mouse across the room because I turn a corner and a monster blows out my eardrums is astronomical Gotta keep you on your toes\\n\\nReal talk Its a firstperson haunted maze solving game with AI enemies and lots of screaming with your friends Its really special to me and the unique AI logic and consistent updates really give this game such a spark Couldnt recommend a  player PvE coop horror game more If you dont care about leveling up playing on infinite lives is a joy A fun scary puzzle game to play with friends Each area have different monsters that you have to figure out how to avoid Though the Miner on chapter  needs reworked Fell in love with this game instantly Love hunting cosmetics and getting lost in the mazes with my friends The story is still in development but this is by far one of my favorite survival horror games  Case files are SO GOOD Procedural generation is great New maze each time new monsters different puzzles Hardcore cases are a great challenge as well and the rainbow outfit is beautiful So happy to have returned for the Easter event with the floppy ears Having a lot of fun playing Labyrinthine But FU Pigman This game is incredible\\n\\nI bought it awhile back when there were only  chapters and no case files to play with a small group of friends and it was some of the most fun Ive ever had\\n\\nNow I have been revisiting the chapters and playing the new ones with friends and with case files I will be playing this game for awhile more in the future Looking for event cosmetics and finding things in procedurally generated maps is really enjoyable for me and all my friends I have a lot of fun with labyrinthine There are two modes the story and case files The story has  chapters that ease you into the game with different mechanics and monsters It would probably take maybe  hourish to complete the whole story so the replayability comes with the case files A case file has a different map a lot of which are taken from the story difficulty number of monsters and size how big the map is In the case file you go around a maze completing the map objectives usually finding items around the map mostly in safe rooms and the go to the exit the complete the level The case files are a bit repetitive but the devs have been adding in new monsters and maps over time The devs are very transparent and respond well to feedback and have done a good job adding content and improving the game over time \\nOverall if you have a friend or two that you can play with this game is a lot of fun The game play is terrifying and refreshing however the AI of the enemies is ridiculous like they need a rework please mazes are nearly impossible with the aim bot they have so as this is early access I dont think I can recommend this game right now needs more work and AI tweaking\\n\\nthank you Hi Just dropping in here on a whim a letting you fellas know that this game is fun If u have friends i dont play it with them and have a blast  boy i sure do feel like im in a labyrinth or something h aMAZEing Coop Horror Game h\\nI have been playing Lab since its inception Oct  and I have to say it is my favorite Coop horror game on the market Its simple to start but hard to master especially with scaling difficulty new players get easier options experienced players get more difficult options The Dev team is very responsive to feedbackquestions on Discord and is always looking to improve gameplay with new content Character customization is getting to be very rewarding with frequent releases of various cosmetics both permanently in game and for limitedtime special events This game definitely encourages multiplayer rather than single player but it is not impossible to play by yourself If you know you do not enjoy mazes in games or real life this is NOT the game for you But if you genuinely enjoy being scared in a horror game while using your brain to problem solve with the help of some friends then PURCHASE THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY Definitely give Labyrinthine a shot and if you need help finding people to play with just join the Valko Studios Discord server Great game bought on a whim with friends and we played through the first  chapters in one sitting The new chapters contained a variety of monsters and were still fun I positively love this game as do many people in my server We recommend to people all the time Ive been playing this game for a long time and am still in love with it If you want a fun spooky game where you are trying to solve puzzles while running through a maze and away from monsters  then this is it Despite having reached nearly level  I still end up screaming when I get jumped scared by a monster \\n\\nA lot of people are being super negative about the newest chapter that came out  and thats not fair I personally loved the newest and last chapter chapter  There were some little bugs here and there but they honestly just released it Its to be expected Even still I would play it again and probably will Granted I think Chapter  was one of the hardest ones for me and my friends just because of the final monster We thought Chapter  was rough but they got us with Chapter  But in a good way \\n\\nAll in all I would  recommend this game Especially if you have friends to play it with Its a lot of fun that youll end up spending hours playing in one sitting This game is amazing and a worth play even if its once or twice the game has an amazing replay value in its case files and that only seems to become bigger and bigger the more devs add in maps fun game to play with friends or alone if your really up for a spooky fun time And the dev team are so nice and helpful This game run out of ideas past chapter   The game is crap if you want to be extremely infuriated the entire time and go through skull numbing pain of being killed by things that dont fucking do what they are supposed to do The ran out of fucking ideas and wasted hours of my fucking life i wish i could refund this piece of sit fuck this dumb ass game I WANT A FUCKING REFUND FOR WASTING MY FUCKING LIFE Absolutely HORRIFYING\\nIts a wonderful fun and scary experience  One of us found a new husband and all of us have gotten massively addicted  i luv the monsters except the way they sound sometimes too scary i poo but i loved every second of it i like getting lost and wandering around mazes for hours on end  While this game is fun at first youll grow tired of it very quickly Chapter  was a let down and made absolutely no sense Multiplayer gets dull and outside of grinding for cosmetics which by the way doesnt stop you from getting duplicates cosmetics that do nothing for you Making it a pointless grind Youll grind out tickets the currency that lets you buy certain items from the in game shop Most of the time youll buy reroll tokens that let you roll for different maps in the hope you get either a rare map or a pentagram map The more cosmetics you get the harder it becomes to get the ones you dont have to the point you could probably spend weeks never getting the ones you want unless you know someone in their Discord server that has the item you want \\n\\nThe harder difficulties arent all that hard just tedious and annoying because the maps are randomly generated at first and you might have  monsters camping at the entrance due to horrible generation where there is only one path out of spawn and can sometimes be a rather long path that almost makes it impossible to get far without having to turn back so you dont die to the monsters patrolling that area \\n\\nDont get me wrong I loved this game at first and Ive had a lot of fun playing with friends having some of the best laughs and jump scares But theres been no changes or new maps no new monsters no growth in terms of content outside of seasonal cosmetics that still compete with nonseasonal cosmetics at the same time I want to play this game sometimes but I just cant bring myself to do it anymore\\n\\nTLDR Fun game at first with friends story had a poor ending Multiplayer with friends starts out as fun but after a while gets boring because after a while youre grinding to get cosmetics that you want but will almost never see due to duplicates Labyrinthine isnt bad but it does get really tedious to play the longer you play While I got towards the end of chapter  my friends and I decided to just quit because of how annoying it gets at the end\\nIt is really fun when you first start though but chapter after chapter is the same thing theres lore that gets relevant at the end but youre to busy actually playing the game to read the lore so it ends up annoying and is why the ending I searched it up falls flat The game has potential and I think if there was more variety it would keep the game fun and scary This game was amazing as hell but lately theyve gone down the insect  phobia route with absolutely ZERO WARNINGS THAT IT CONTAINS THE MOST COMMON PHOBIAS IN EXISTANCE Chapter  has a massive spider its just not okay The game doesnt need the ridiculous insects I cant recommend this game anymore simply due to the insects Its just wrong Ill happily recommend this to my friends if they get rid of the cheap insect  phobia triggering nonsense But as for now Absolutely not Starts out strong but every chapter is worse than the last Post catacomb chapter is where there is no fun to be had at all Developer just starts copy pasting the same  rooms over and over again to where theres no recognition of where you are at all Or its a big area with hills that you cant tell are environmental walls or not with tons of invisible walls I thought I was breaking the game at some points when it was the actual path The final area is the worst as its a big open area that when you get to the end and get a birds eye view is literally the same copy pasted square on all sides More time should of been spent on level design instead of trying to force microtransactions into the game with daily quest randomizer Well well well if it isnt Labyrinthine  the game that gave me more jumpscares than my ex did during our relationship Honestly I had no idea what I was getting into when I downloaded this game but now I know what it feels like to have a heart attack\\n\\nThe graphics are so good that I kept forgetting I was in a game and not actually being chased by a demon And dont even get me started on the sound effects I had to play with the volume turned all the way down just so I wouldnt wake up my neighbors with my screaming\\n\\nBut let me tell you the real horror in this game is trying to figure out where the heck youre supposed to go The labyrinthine pun intended layout of this game is enough to make anyone feel like theyre wandering aimlessly in a maze I may have gotten lost a few times but at least I didnt run into any ghosts while doing it I think\\n\\nAll in all if youre looking for a game that will give you nightmares then Labyrinthine is the perfect choice Just make sure you have a change of pants handy because you might need them If your a huge Phasmophobia game this game will also do u well if even better Labyrinthine is just such a unique and enjoyable experience that also adds that huge scare in it This is one of the scariest games due to the aesthetics and the monsters in the mazes If your looking for a coop horror game this game is ur pride and joy\\nContent   So enjoyable just wish there was a PVP mode were someone could play as the monster\\nGraphics   Peak graphics So good for a indie game\\nStory   The campaign was really fire however the end didnt feel like a true wrap up and some of the missions in the campaign were not the greatest\\nBugs   In Early Access but Still little buggy\\nTheme   Coop Horror Maze game\\nReplayability   If we arent playing Phas its Labyrinthine\\nMusic   The background music in this game IS PERFECT\\nOverall   Masterpiece of a horror game top  horror game ive ever played Grindy Windy and Findy Adequate Spookage Chapter  Big No No Bueno Case Files Quite Meh solid  The Story mode is plenty creepy with lots of tough puzzles and the random generated mazes will keep you coming back for more Make sure to play with friends So fun with friends \\nAnd you get to yeet glowsticks everywhere Honestly Chapter    Are Really Enjoyable Maps Are Fun And Quite Scary but    Feels Really Random Especially The Newest Chapter Personally I Feel Like The Creatures Just Straight Up Teleports Or Knows Where We Are Theres No Way That My Friends That Got Killed Near The Checkpoint Instantly Appeared Near Me\\nAnd The Temple Level Is Ass  BLOODY GREAT GAME NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART AMAZING JUMPS AND SCARY ATMOSPHERE OVERALL WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LOVES SCARY GAMES WOULD LOVE TO SEEM MORE FROM THE GAME AND MORE GAMES FROM THE DEVELOPERS IN GENERAL amazing game couldnt recommend this enough such a great game with friends A horror game where you are placed in different labyrinths spiked with traps and monsters The goal of each chapter involves exploration puzzle solving and then escaping The game is simple and has a cool mechanics such as proximity chat and a feature that lets you can drop infinite glow sticks on the ground making tracing paths much easier A underrated game that is fun to play with others  Overall I had enough fun with friends to recommend this one but bear in mind you are delving into some potentially very frustrating mazes which could render you lost for an unfortunate amount of time The ending was pretty mid but I enjoyed most of the journey and the contract maps Ive played were all pretty fun Its nothing special but if youre looking for some spooky mazey fun with the homies thisll scratch that super niche itch and its not gonna bankrupt you my friends and i get some cheap laughs out of it but i would  not recommend it has potential but takes a really lazy approach to horror games unfortunately \\n\\ncame back for the chapter  update and its just even worse theyre not even trying to incorporate the roaming enemies correctly ive watched them dissapear in front of me to reappear somewhere near a friend super lazy its a shame because the environments and atmosphere are always pretty decent but there isnt much going on beyond the surface Chapter  is the wordt thing ever After finding  skulls and then dying because in this chapter you keep on dying my task is find joan without having to finish the skulls Seems like a glitch and now I have to do it aaaaaall again The mines are terrible as well way to hard Chapter  is the best\\n This game genuinely puts a fear in me i didnt realize could be possible playing a scary game even when my graphics had to be turned all the way down to run it on my old bum pc it still made me scared but is heavily fun and really interesting and definitely makes you use your brain more then you know The game was great until Chp  to th the secret ending is incredibly difficult to get and the steps are extremely obscure to the point I dont believe someone can naturally find all items my friends all feel extremely frustrated at the secret ending requirements notes instructions to the secret ending should be available if not already and easier to obtain please lower the amount of steps me and my friends loved your project but after six hours of the secret ending attempt only to fail ruined the experience Its a really nice game I wish It had more playtime sounds are a bit loud and might be annoying sometimes but overall I really like it would recommend it for friends who wanna play a multiplayer horror game Got this for  friends and myself and had a lot of fun with the first  chapters but the next  feel like they devolve into what is basically like Slender I also want there to be more ways to kind of deal with the different monsters The designs and story are great I just want this game to be polished up with how great it can be My advice to future players is to either wait till it is out of early access or receives some bigger updates This game has so much potential THIS GAME MADE ME WANT TO PULL OUT MY HAIR BY HOW INFURIATING IT WAS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE PARTS IN PEACE  though  This is the perfect game for a Horror Game night with ur friends I recommend to play it with  to  ppls \\nU need to solve Puzzels and Quiz while u are not alone in the Labyrinthe Sometimes u get separated from ur friends and u need to find them again\\nThis is one of the best Game weve ever played I highly recommend this game Great job guys D We need more leveeeeelssss \\n level  and  were my fav I hope they make it easier to know how not to die in the other levels lol  some of the other levels they spawn camp overall recommend for an interesting MAZE escape game What a great game hermano Good stuff good ending Played with  other friends we all loved it Really worth the waiting for the last chapter Would I recommend this game Yes Personally Ive loved majority of it Both the story chapters as well as the cases However I do think this is a game you need to play in multiplayer rather than single player And truth be told the story line is meh at best especially the final chapter felt disappointing Other than that great game many monsters and scares  Graphics  You forget what reality is Beautiful Good Decent Bad Dont look too long at it MSDOS Gameplay  Very good Good Its just gameplay Mehh Watch paint dry instead Just dont Audio  Eargasm Very good Good Not too bad Bad Im now deaf Audience  Kids Teens Adults Grandma PC Requirements  Check if you can run paint Potato Decent Fast Rich boi Ask NASA if they have a spare computer Difficulty  Just press W Easy Easy to learn  Hard to master Significant brain usage Difficult Dark Souls Grind  Nothing to grind Only if u care about leaderboardsranks Isnt necessary to progress Average grind level Too much grind Youll need a second life for grinding Story  No Story Some lore Average Good Lovely Itll replace your life Game Time  Long enough for a cup of coffee Short Average Long To infinity and beyond Price  Its free Worth the price If its on sale If u have some spare money left Not recommended You could also just burn your money Bugs  Never heard of Minor bugs Can get annoying ARK Survival Evolved The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs               fun and love the visual variety and every second is creepy and scares well  for adventure horror pretty fun game very easy to mindlessly walk through the casefiles without having to put too much thought into it I absolutely love collecting all the cosmetics the game also always seems to be growing and expanding so more new things keep coming  Developer if youre seeing this you need a big smooch Fantastic game my boy and I keep coming back every time they release a new chapter and we just beat the last one Great time Definitely recommend playing with one or more friends solo is only for horror game sweats But with friends its a blast and definitely requires multiple minds thinking together Its a great game and you can join the discord to talk with other players who love the game too the game gets plenty of updates and its fun to play great experience amazing game will recommend over and over to anyone to play \\n I have never played a game like this before and honestly didnt care for it at first but it grew on me Thanks Now when I play the backrooms I miss having glow sticks A good Idea fun with friends Cosmetics need some balancing spawn is far and few between really awesome just need FRIENDS TO PLAY IT WITH DAMN Worst game since Lula D Killed by my own companion Never playing video games again Ive been playing this game for a while So this is my honest review\\n\\nLabyrinthine is a firstperson horror game that takes place in an eerie and unsettling maze The games atmospheric design coupled with its unique gameplay mechanics make for an intense and immersive horror experience\\n\\nOne of the standout features of Labyrinthine is its sound design The game features a haunting and unsettling soundtrack that adds to the games already creepy atmosphere The sound effects are also very welldone from the creaking of doors to the sound of footsteps in the distance which all help to create a sense of dread and unease\\n\\nThe maze itself is also very welldesigned with a variety of different areas to explore each with its own unique challenges and puzzles The game does a great job of gradually ramping up the difficulty as you progress which keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging\\n\\nThe graphics in Labyrinthine are also quite impressive with detailed textures and lighting effects that really help to bring the game world to life The character models are also very welldone and the animations are smooth and realistic\\n\\nThat being said there are a few aspects of Labyrinthine that could be improved upon The games pacing can sometimes feel slow especially during the early stages of the game Additionally the games storyline is a bit underdeveloped which can make it difficult to become fully invested in the games world and characters\\n\\nOverall Labyrinthine is a great horror game that is sure to give players plenty of thrills and chills Its atmospheric design unique gameplay mechanics and impressive graphics and sound design make it a standout title in the horror genre While its not without its flaws Labyrinthine is definitely worth checking out if youre a fan of horror games and are looking for something new and exciting to sink your teeth into Very fun game with friends please make a sequel or more chapters of this game \\n\\nCant wait to hear more from the dev When a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie thats a Tony fun game loved playing it with my friends Got scared so many times AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Very good horror game Ecspecially good with friends and a great price It is very easy to learn and great to play with friends i will say this for sure if your looking for a horror game look no further myself and friends have played this for quite some time due to waiting on chapters but it was well worth the wait and honestly im a little sad to have beaten it i enjoyed it quite a lot would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a horror game to play coop or even just by yourself Game is really good Overall performance is high tier Been playing this game for over a year waiting for each chapter to be released and I am delighted to of committed and see the ending Would highly recommend this game to anyone that loves horrors and wants to play with your friends Devs have done an amazing job with each level having its own monster species whilst also trying to figure out the monsters weaknesses along with solving puzzles  This game is fun and also scary it used to have minor bugs that make some levels easier but they fixed them already The only issue is the chapter update takes a long time to come but its an earlyaccess game so what can I say Still Im gonna recommend this game tho  Honestly some of the most fun Ive ever had with these bafoon idiots I call my friends  The story chapters were fantastic although it doesnt feel like chapter  is truly the end like they stated   The custom maps have also been really enjoyable only compliant is the maps scale way to drastically For the credits song Tamsin  The Maze you get a  from me fun game with friends actually interesting and spooky totally worth the money I am almost done with chapter  and I have spent  hours playing with my buddy its not perfect but for ten bucks def get it First I want to say the game is still in early access and I adore the concept and am very interested in the story\\n\\nThat being said this game is making me hate it and I cannot recommend it in its current state\\n\\nChapter  the secondary mine level with the spider is horrendous My friend and I have gone through all the rest of the game together and started the new chapter the day it was released and have spent hours on said level already Every level we have been through although difficult in places has somewhat made sense Though in each level there is always a tiny infuriating aspect of game play but I digress \\nThe issues we are having with the spider section are as follows the spider is way too fast and does not give you ample time to hide the secret door is explained in a single hard to find note the spawn point should absolutely not be random and it is frankly boring \\nThere is very little lore and very little new to see as you traverse the area and combining that with the random spawn point It feels rushed unfinished and disheartening to play My friend and I really tried to give it a solid try but it was so infuriating that we just gave up and most likely wont be going back to it in its current state despite our love for the story\\n\\nThe the game has little to no replay ability as the only reason you would do the cases is to get cosmetics or tickets which are super rare \\n\\nso all in all it feels like its on the way to being a great game but it really is just too difficult and not quite user friendly as is Hours of fun well worth the price Ive had several friends get this game now I am saving up for the lollipop glowsticks Shit game Horrible story Joan talks too much Chapters  were okay  was alright Everything after that was Overwatch  type of content Destiny s Lightfall expansion was better than Chapter  The last few chapters just had too much running around Finished the game with chapter  dammn its good scary game to do with friends Would do this again with new firends as I played with my friend so it was a duo and we made it through all the way even though some hardship on the struggles The cardboard ghosts are the scariest thing in the game the game is absolutely amazing especially for the price  Very fun I like hearing the screams of terror from my friends good game randomly generated labyrinths which you will be stuck in for over an hour cause half of it is locked behind  monster infested hallway Great multiplayer fun  the story chapters are great enemies are interesting and the randomised challenge maps are pretty good Sometimes the difficulty can feel harder than advertised Can see a lot of love being poured into this game hope the devs keep it up being stupid at puzzles and mazes is what i do best and tormenting my friends is what i do bester Love it \\nTons of fun if you play with a friend or two and love how every enemy has his own strenghts  weaknesses\\nFrequent updates too \\nGreat game  recommend  good game would be better if you had to run from the fog looking for practice when the fog comes on augest   Very great game Incredibly fun with friends but beware the ending is honestly pretty bad Everything up to that point is incredible but the ending left me kind of expecting more after how good the game is Definitely a great game otherwise Obsessed And even once youre done with the Chapters you can continue on custom cases either randomized or you can generate based on the different maps and monsters you unlock This game is amazinggggg very fun alone or with friends Still havent beaten level  but the cases  chapters  were really good Cant wait for the full release Ive played this game through a couple times good game with friends very fun One of the best horrorpuzzle coop ive played for awhile I always come back to it every update so far and I have the same enjoyment every time \\n\\n Ive found that this game is most enjoyable only with friends as you can play however youd like My group of friends were emersed into the gameplay A little troll here and there but mostly terrified with every step Watching and hearing them scream with their comms fading knowing i cant or dont want to help them Or running and screaming along side them This is how i enjoyed this game Outside of friends Im not sure if you could find a group of people as the few times Ive tried the multiplayer menu it was very empty at the time with few open lobbies Best chance would be the discord maybe No friends No idea im sorry\\n\\nReplayability is amazing outside of story They give you  randomized maps to choose from thI really enjoyed it I enjoy the search for cosmetics and dodging monster mechanics then doing it all over again  The hardcore maps were prob one of the best additions It created a risk of losing a coolrare cosmetic to the map and losing permanently I have barely surfaced hardcore maps for rare cosmetics but the rise in difficulty when you cant just replay and memorize the maze Every death counts and you miss a chance for a cosmetic\\n\\nGame is getting amazing updates The story was what hooked me in the beginning but the case update was what kept me in Theyve been adding new monsters and maps and new areas into old maps So far Ive yet to get sick of the game The campaign is fun and thrilling some chapters arent designed as good as others but overall pretty fun solo or with a group of friends That being said its quite short and most replayability lies within the multiplayer which is where I have most of my hours \\n\\nPersonally the first  hours of multiplayer was fun discovering new maps playing against new monsters and the works However it gets demotivating very quickly I am not sure if the developers have a certain definition for their difficulties but one of the hardest difficulties extreme is borderline unplayable even with a group of  Maybe its meant to be impossible but I dont see the point I think the difficulties should be hard but doable For example on extreme maps theres at least  monsters and any one of them can easily kill you If you are playing on a small or very small map theres a monster every corner waiting for you\\n\\nOn the topic of map sizes I get that the game is supposed to be a maze however there are some games I played that lasted literally  minutes trying to find the last objective while dodging monsters it gets pretty tiring Speaking of tiring because there is no stamina and you can run as long as you want I am not sure why you have to keep holding the sprint button a quality of life change to this making it a toggle would be great I know theres a workaround with this but it should be in the game\\n\\nThe straw that broke the camels back Events I have played a few events but not really going for any items until the recent Valentines one I get that cosmetics are optional and something to work for but I dont like the current RNG system I really wish they revamped the system Currently there isnt much to buy in the store with tickets and you start to hoard a bunch of tickets so it would be nicer if you could buy event cosmetics with tickets instead of praying to your deity of choice and hoping the item you want isnt a duplicate \\n\\nLastly case files the chances of one being rare is quite low I have used over  reroll tokens and only found one rare case file maybe small sample size but considering that reroll tokens cost a lot of tickets and if you dont have friends to play with youre out of luck So to summarize events in a nutshell reroll case files until you get a rare case file pray that the case file HAS the event cosmetic  chance and pray that you dont get a duplicate item Or spend  minutes playing whatever case files the game throws at you checking every house and key areas good luck with that\\n\\nOverall If you are looking for a fun campaign game to play with friends and expect to finish the game in  hours then I would recommend it The discord is active and there are plentiful of updates however I cant on good conscious recommend the multiplayer given how many times I spent wandering around maps for  minutes In the future Ill probably return for the new campaign releases but dear god unless something is done to the multiplayer system I dont think Ill play that again This game is fun but literally you have to grind this game so hard to get anything When I say anything I mean the tickets tokens and especially the Valentine things Dont get me wrong though Im level  smt and I have hella tickets and everything but I feel like the devs should make it more easier for the players to get event things Play this game if you are down to grind for hours and hours without a chance of getting something back except levels and tokens Very fun loads of potential content could be added in the future scary Obviously and great with multiple people\\n When that ghost popped out of the hedge a noise came out of my mouth that ive never heard before Best part is triggering smiley behind your friend so they get downed  I just love this game\\n\\nIf you really like exploration getting lost jump scares feeling hunted and love to hear your friends scream in terror like you never heard them before  this is the game for you\\n\\nHad tons of fun with story and case gameplay this far  alone as well as with friends\\n\\nGreat variety active development game works very well Tons of cosmetics to unlock for your toons\\n\\nIf you decide play this game in VR it is many times over even more scary Worked very well for me on a Meta Quest  \\njust go to the toilet first or you might soil yourself XD  Very spooky very fun Definitely better with at least  friend Me and my friends have been playing for about a week or so Weve been having a good time learning monster mechanics and strategizing our glowstick usage both in color and shape Looking forward to new maps and monsters in the future  Graphics \\n You forget what reality is\\n Beautiful\\n Good\\n Decent\\n Bad\\n Dont

game holy fuck listen if you want a good co op horror this does not let you down EVEN in its early access stages it has been a blast to play I have recorded MANY YT videos from this game with my mates and plan to make many more \\nLots of options for gameplay difficulty the chapters are really fun to go through and give a different experience to the normal maps With content still being released I am sure this game will only continue to grow on me and my friends Played hours of this game and while its only fun with your friends the chance of trying to get a new cosmetic in this game is beyond abysmal Repeat cosmetics even during events is what killed the game for me Audio and mic system in this game is awful \\n   the gates slamming shut are unreasonably loud\\n   the friendly speak range seems unreasonably small\\n\\nAi needs an overhaul ramping up the difficulty just means being locked into a  safe room for  minutes\\n\\nOverall Im currently having fun but I cant see myself playing this for  hrs without some major overhaul work Super scary lots of replayability and I also met the love of my life on this game  This game is one of my all time favourites I totally recommend Its a great horror coop The puzzles and scares are a great combo\\n\\nGreat job team Thank you for making such a great game I cannot wait for the final map Amazing game that is super fun to play with  to  friends I highly recommend to anyone wanting a little scary and to play with a few buddies We are truly enjoying the puzzles mazes and the surprises  I would definitely recommend it One of the best horror coop games Ive ever played \\nI hope there will be more games like this  I hate being jumpscared but I just cannot stop playing this game I love it fun game but needs some updatemore maps items monsters skins etc super fun horror game scary and great to play with friends definitely want more content I found this game a couple months ago with my friend King Samuel P We did the story had a blast and then grinded to over level  on the cases It is a very nice game especially when you first download it shits scary Even after you get on after a while you can get scared by it  hours played and I do not regret playing them you get some scares have fun and overall its a great game I just wish that the chapter production would come out faster as well as more mobs and more case file maps  \\n\\n Awesome game very spooky  Especially those small paper ghost \\n for the glowsticks love to throw them all over the map and helps you see where you already went if youre looking for things or want to get back to something \\nNice maps and monsters but some of them need fixing while others are really easy to handle some of them see or hear you from very far away or around the corners and the sounds are really loud sometimes even with lowering the volume \\nAll in all a really nice game makes fun and playing together with friends is even better iM WRITING THIS REVIEW SO MY FRIEND WILL BUY AND DOWNLOAD THE GAME\\n One of the best horror coop games to play with ya mates A game that me and my friends love There has obvious been put a lot of love and labor into this game and you can really feel that the developers care Also a very good and supporting community good game with friends cheap for wat it is i feel like  not sleeping tonight I love this game I loved the story i love the case files i love grinding for cosmetics and for its price its more than well worth it \\n\\nHowever there are so many flaws in this game that i dont know how its close to being finished The variety of map sizes and monsters in case files is a good way to keep things fresh however when you put  monsters on the map and we end up stuck in spawn for  minutes before just re rolling the map is a joke \\n\\nMonster AI also needs a massive overhaul Some monsters are genuinely pointless and make the map easy then on the other side there are the monsters who are a ridiculous Can see round corners hear you from a mile away twice as fast as the player with no way of slowing them down That isnt fun its stupid especially adding in the fact the monsters dont roam they just camp you wherever you happen to be \\n\\nAudio is awful I have no other way of putting it Id love to see some changes made to the warnings you get when a monster is close by Some are perfect and make it possible to track the monster and avoid them However some merely play elevator music when theyre in the same map as you giving you no way of tracking them or knowing where they are Feels lazy and ruins maps I actively try and avoid playing trenches because not only is the map the worst on this game by miles the monster ill call Slender Digits is broken \\n\\nThis game is well worth playing and buying but could become an essential game to play if things are changed\\n\\nUpdate \\n\\nGame is so much better in so many areas that this game is still an absolute bargain \\n\\nHowever extreme difficulty is a joke Monsters still continue to group together Continue to follow the same path and continue to camp you no matter where you are If youre looking for an exit or a safe room then just look for where the monsters are camping \\n\\nSuch a good game let down by frustrating mechanics that havent been fixed forgot to review this two years ago great game definitely one of my favorites This game is really scawy I always run back to my waifus for protection he centipede is super scawy it even scares my wafius One of my favorite multiplayer horror games highly recommend for friend groups that enjoy puzzle solving and surviving in first person Probably the best indie horror game next to Phasmophobia Keep at it Valko Game Studios got merch from the store and was totally worth it the little ghost gets me even if I see it highly recommend Pig Man and Claw Guy can go to hell  You too Deer Head A great game with a very friendly and welcoming community Its always nice to play a few rounds farming cosmetics and meet new people in the official Discord yes it make me screem and pee and haves fun very awesom \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuen juego para jugarlo con amigos y pasar algunos sustos i b Likes b i Really love the story chapters\\ni b Dislikes b i Not really a fan of the contracts as its kinda repetitive but they working on adding new varieties which is nice\\ni b

Early Access which lenience is given\\nAudio is loud enough to wake the dead\\nStartling which is kinda the games tension builder\\nspoilerSkip Kingspoiler\\n\\n\\nbOpinionb\\n\\n     This game is a great timesink in its gameplay loop Its a very simple game to pick up and learn It can be startling but if you adjust the volume to tolerable levels and learn the monsters you get to be confident quickly Procedural Cases are the best game loop Ive playing in a while and Im looking forward to more being added over time this is a good game\\n\\nlooking forward to the future updates Great game very active development and great replayability Labyrinthine is a under rated hidden gem of a horror game The game makes you genuinely tense and be able to have fun with your friends sometimes being able to watch them die from behind metal bars games cheap as well definitely recommend getting couple friends together for this game I love this game Its so simple and yet so fun honestly cant believe that a big studio hasnt picked up the concept before Have been playing with friends every other night and have yet to be bored of it They did a great job at the randomly generated maps and simple objectives but need to have the monsters respawn when out of sight at a safe room or something having the monsters camp spawn or a safe room can be rough at times Other than that I thing this is one of the most fun coop horror games I have ever played No learning curve simple design great soundtrack and story to boot and so so SO much potential Definitely cant wait for more levels and monsters in the future Crossing my fingers to have a monster similar to spoiler The hallucinated baby spoiler from Resident Evil  Sooo fun VR just launched and its buggy but Im so excited to experience it once its all cleared up Its cool for the story mode\\n\\nThe custom maps are not really implemented well When you pass the story mode and want to try out the custom maps youll be dissappointed You only get access to  easiest difficulty which has only the most basic of basic mechanics After  games youve seen it all be prepared to have to grind those mind numbing easy stages over and over and over again to hope the higher difficulty will be more fun\\n\\nThe monsters are interesting when you encounter them for the first time The pig butcher is too fucking loud After that its just the exact same thing You hear the noise it makes and you pretty much know how to dodgeavoid the monster\\n\\nIve been checking out updates for the game every now and again but theres literally no meaningful updates other than adding cosmetics once a month\\n\\nKnow that youre paying for maybe h of story which is quite good and endless mind numbing grindfest of the same custom game but this time the map is a bit different\\n\\nI really enjoyed this game for what it was if you want some spooky puzzles go ahead A very enjoyable horror experience to play with your friends If you enjoy exploring huge maps with your friends while dealing with little green ghouls this is the game for you \\n\\nGameplay Fantastic\\n The gameplay is simple youre in a maze you explore and find areas of interest to complete puzzles all while avoiding some horrible monster ready to burst your ear drums \\n \\n I like to explore huge maps so naturally I enjoyed this gameplay loop If you dislike more slow gameplay and prefer more active gameplay similar to that of Devour maybe this game isnt for you but Id say still try it\\n\\nGraphics Fantastic\\n The atmosphere environments and monsters are incredible to look at You truly feel as if youre in a horrible place This world with VR would be awesome to experience The player models are kinda funky though one of the main ones looks like Toby McGuire so if you like Spiderman this is your game\\n\\nCampaign Solid\\n Starts off very strong with the first two chapters being very atmospheric nearing liminal space like Lots of spooky set pieces outside of the monsters to creep you out \\n\\n Chapter  is just fine pretty creepy experience when you find the main area but other than that you can sometimes never encounter the monster \\n\\n Chapter  is great not as good as the first two chapters but still fantastic Very claustrophobic experience almost suffocating \\n\\n Chapter  is not good Not gonna sugar coat it there really isnt anything supernatural here enemies are annoying and its a giant fetch quest and it ends by putting a monster right at the end of the chapter after you complete a ridiculous puzzle as a giant middle finger just in case you managed to get through Monster designs are cool despite not being scary \\n\\nReplayability Good\\n You get these little case files which are randomized mazes with different sizes themes and monsters You complete them to level up and get crazier maps Very fun to do despite being somewhat repetitive Amazing game Devs take good care of this game Definitely worth the price Best CoOp Horror game I have ever played Most fun playing a computer game I have had with my friends in ages Updated th July   Just completed the game the story mode Its been a while since I bought it  and it still is great The story mode is just amazing the game is just worth it for that but it also has a completely plotseparated game Yup im talking about the custom cases This is where the multiplayer fun really starts I wont spoil anything but I really recommend to join the official Discord server to find people to make team with and find cosmetics Also its a very friendly community in which developers are really involved in\\n\\nJust an amazing game\\n\\nGreat job Valko Team  I have had a ton of fun with this game\\n\\nChapters\\nBeen replaying them all as new chapters come out just to make sure to see any changes or revamps the team might have done to previous ones over time\\n  Pros Good introduction to the game with elements introduced slow enough to implement them in future game play\\n Cons Notes on the monsters you come across while amusing do not get looked at enough by players which in turn causes them frustration because they dont know how to deal with each monsters weakness\\n\\nCase Files\\nThis is the bread and butter of the game Where the replay ability is at The players even when solo have a degree of control over how hard each map will be Notes on monsters still present which helps them learn of the different monsters weakness for the ones seen in the chapters \\n\\nMore notes on others needed at the time of this review so I recommend visiting the wiki or discord to learn more as a new player\\n\\nCase maps can be soloed or up to  people Yes there is going to be sections of the map that seem pointless to some players but that is a Labyrinth Not all parts of it will be useful to the player at first glance Through game play you will learn how helpful those sections really are\\n\\nNew Players Go slow take your time learning the game and its monsters and you will have even more fun as time passes This is a slow burner this game is an absolute fething clusterfrak of gak even when in full premade group of  maze runners  times out of  its going to phallicaly block you in one way or another or in several cause why the hell not contains an ungodly amount of bad and needless rng with devs not even focusing on actual issues \\n\\nthere are plenty of easy quick andor dirty possible fixes for many if not all issues but no lets add needless anticheat measures for pve coop which the coop part is basically required as your chance for nice gaming time is reduced to abysmal numbers if not in fully active party unless Lady Luck is gazing and drooling all over you or you cheat or you enjoy that type of heresy a bit too much game and the anticheat is worthless anyway cause you can still find plenty of them around getting into details about the issues would be a whole chapter in and of itself monsters issues maps issues etcs issues\\n\\none map can take you anywhere from few minutes to several hours and hundredths of deathsrespawns restarts why cause apparently its a new Oxford Dictionarys definition of fun i wonder tho what is so fun about being stuck in one incredibly long by virtue of travel time through it into actual maze part entrance that doesnt have safezone with all of the monsters camping you there for dozens of minutes before allowing you one chance to get someone out to try and solve whats necessary not to mention the monster combinations that can and will make it impossible for you to escape once youre inevitably found out of reach from safezone and if its a guaranteed cosmetic map congrats its  chance of a duplicate that everyone in your party or at least you already has and have seen it at least a dozen times beats me trully maybe if youre a masochist with equally masochistic friends with enough spare time and energy on your hands to outlive the Sol \\n\\nbut it can get fun when the stars align and youre not jerked around from the get go when you have a nice chill premade to chat and mazerun when you have have someone to make cute noises when spookedscared when you finally find a cosmetic at least someone is missing when and if\\n\\nbut it has potential and fairly active dev team even tho they do not imo focus properly and thats more that you can say about most semimodern games oh and the story so far is promising too Labyrinthine is truly a hidden gem It has a learning curve like most of the  person coop horror games that have been coming out over the last few years These devs put so much love into this game and are constantly adding new content Cosmetic grinding in Labyrinthine is one of my favorite things to do\\n\\n I do really hope to see a Solo rework in the future to help with replayability for solo gaming content creators like myself The more xp I get the harder my cases are I can do the harder cases with friends but they feel impossible for me as a solo player and I end up going broke having to reroll or customize cases so I can continue to create content for this game At a point I have to switch games because im stuck which I never want to do because I truly love this game so much Really Scary at times and fun with friends Would recommend Fun at first but then got too repetitive Same old puzzles finding the same cosmetic purple beanie  times ina row they did a patch supposedly where the AI isnt supposed to camp you no they just follow me on twitter and know my location cause I forgot to turn on my vpn Theres other horror early access games that came out way after and have more stuff to it Youre better off spending your money on ANYTHING else\\n\\nLet the community mod the game and itll be x better better maps and better monsters Yall had your chance its the same boring repetitive one dimensional gameplay Pls let the people mod Fun game would recommend\\nUpdate It is still fun  hours in PMC Entertaining horror game with loud sounds which is even better x Absolutely amazingly horrifying Each level has its own feel and challenges Cant wait for chapter  Love that you have both storys and cases Love that the cases arent all the same so the game doesnt get boring according to me Otherwise I wouldnt have over  hours in this game The only thing I would like is more achivments since Ive done all of them already Labyrinthine is and will allways be in my heart ever since i first played it in beta of  The game is about a thrilling cooperative survival horror game where you and your friends or random peolpe explore a dark shifting maze filled with terrifying creatures and intricate puzzles The atmosphere is unnervingly tense What relly is great about the game is the monsters witch both are fun scary and atmospheric The game also bring alot of its good cosmetic that there are in the game The first three story chapters were absolutely amazing drawing me in with their captivating narrative While the story does lose a bit of steam toward the end its still very enjoyable and very worth experiencing\\nIts really sad that Labyrinthine has come to an end and were only getting small updates witch is relly great and love they allways give us something new with new cosmetics for events like Halloween Christmas and so on Something Ill  will always remember is the thrill of exploring the maze with my friends and its relly good community were we all shared good memories witch each others The game was exciting and interesting at the beginning if you played it with friends but eventually it became boring and not scary at all This game is fantastic and my friends and I always have a good time whenever we get together to play it We love all of the chapters and the randomly generated case files are always a fun challenge\\n\\nAW YEAH Labyrinthine won  VR Game of the Year Well deserved Valko Games Were looking forward to your next project Hours of fun Laugh at your friends for all the spooks This game has come so far In the beginning when I first bought this game It took a while to get to level  but after a while I stopped playing because not much was changing same thing over and over again After a while I saw a large update come out and it is now in my rotation to play this game almost twice a week atleast Gathering cosmetics or going through Challenges The new maps they added were great along with the creatures I look forward to see what they bring into play next I shouldnt get jumpscared by this game but those crocodiles and gumby though So fun and the developers are great at responding on discord I  Recommend this game if you have friends Its super funny and at the same time scary The devs have worked super hard for this game and i do not regret buying for me and my friends Im very hyped for the next update Awesome game to play with friends many spooks and laughs to be had\\nAlso lead dev bought me a kebab  If you need a game to play in the background while you talk to friends this is great A lot of replayability I will always recommend this game especially considering the price point Its also worth mentioning that the community is very friendly I gotta say this has got to be one of the best horror games Ive played Ive beta tested some of the content and it keeps getting better and better I have gotta the upmost fear from dogs pigs bugs and other ghastly beasts The multiplayer and mechanics are top tier me and my friends have never suffered so much in a single game like this The best part is there are always more challenges with bigger and harder maps  recommend if you want to suffer  Love this game Best with friends Play using IN GAME chat \\n\\n A fastpaced and highly interactive adventure combining the elements of different type of frightful creatures in endless tangled mazes Problemsolving is just the start the team will need to work closely together highlighting teamwork making decisions under pressure trust leadership and learning from experience Escaping the Labyrinth can be run as a competitive exercise where accountability and communication are key Besides this game could also be a thrilling platform for you and your friends to hang around and chill I would personally recommend this game for horror games lovers it is highly replayable good game if you like fun games really scary would recommend As good of a spooky multiplayer game as Phasmophobia and I dont say that lightly yet not nearly as popular for some reason Great replayability with tons of cool cosmetics and randomly generated maps and monsters My friends and I had enough fun in the story mode to give this a  but with the custom mazes and extra content it may as well be an  The devs seem to support this game like its their baby lol Highly recommended especially if you have  other friends Literally just bring your phasmo friends with you for this one youll have a blast  Very good game its a lot of fun and the horror is good too Really good game to play with friends but it can become tedious in the long run\\nOverall a good game waiting to see how it will turn out at the end of develpment  I love spooky games and I love playing them solo or with friends and this has shown great capability for both The story was relatively easy to follow but quite spooky and good at weening you into the mechanics of the game The poststory procedurally generated mode with randomized cases varying in size and difficulty add some great replayability value coupled with the chance to find cosmetics make me keep wanting to come back for more All in all a great game for the price and Id rate it  It is super fun to play I can go for a few hours at a time and still be entertained We had come across it and at first decided against it but I am really glad we went back The monsters can still scare me even if I hear them coming You can play story or just side cases Either way I think you and your friends can find it a good source of entertainment If you are a cosmetic collector there are definitely a good amount to find It can kill the fun when you get constant duplicates even with a new system they introduced But I hope that one day they will find a good balance This is truly scary with excellent ProcGens as well as a strong introducer via the story chapters It feel claustrophobic like any good jump scare game With the puzzles being fairly simple they dont detract from the fun of having all sorts of monsters rip your head off or run you through or any of the other intrinsically sweet methods of dying Apart from the bloody tile puzzle  squares of aaaggghhhh D The suspense of being stalked through the various areas is well done with appropriately distanced music and sound effects  even the music in the safe areas is suitably disturbing Grab it for  quid an absolute bargain Lots more to come from this invested team Beware of persistent goosebumps mild hallucinations and eardrums being ripped\\n\\nAs an originally big fan of Phasmo who then eventually lost interest and was looking for new casual coop horror games I gotta admit Labyrinthine absolutely got me good I didnt know anything about this game so I gave it a shot with low expectations and I left it thoroughly impressed It has great level design and replayability\\nYou can also collect tickets to buy new cosmetics and there is some sort of reroll random maps feature you can play through the Case Files mode Furthermore you can buy oneuse items helping you get through said randomly generated maps and you can unlock new ones by leveling up There is also currently  main chapters with different themes and mechanics I highly recommend sticking with the Proximity Chat since some of the monsters react aggressively to noise\\n\\nI look forward to future updates and think this could become a great coop horror staple if it gets good love and development It has just the right amount of scares and anxiety inducing moments Very fun experience\\n The game is a great jumpscare game Its never completely the same Doesnt really ever get boring so fun and actually really scary but theres this bug where if you have open mic with friends and get lost from them you can hear their mics like cut out and its really annoying but overall really fun game monsters get stuck sometimes its really funny AMAZING GAME Me and My friend play this every night without fail I LOVE THIS GAME Its spooky creepy i love that you level up and get rewards which is nice and i love the cosmetics the only thing i would like is another character you can play in a group of  but there are only  character models As with any kind of reviews negative ones are given a lot easier than positive ones Weve had some groups that have been unhappy with Chapter  and rather than one person leave a review all  have which takes around  positive reviews to counter Of course we dont mind genuine negative reviews but it can give the wrong impressions when  reviews in a row are all slating the game based on one group not liking the content Im gonna start this with I dont like horror games however I love this game Its fun to hang out with friends and play through a randomly generated map I like finding the secrets hidden in the map like cosmetics One time my friend phased through a wall and found a tiara on a statue of the Archivist Its a great time and feel its not too horribly scary for those who are weak to the horror genre like me Strongly recommend play alone or with friends Definitly a good gameI played coop and it was funDont know if it is the sme solo or in the online mode but I think if you really want to enjoy it then bring a friendtrust meLoved the game sad that it is finishedWOuld have loved to see a lot more levels ive never laughed so hard as i did when my friends were more scared of laughs of one another or a child then the maps monster\\n Beware of persistent goosebumps mild hallucinations and eardrums being ripped\\n\\nAs an originally big fan of Phasmo who then eventually lost

theres still no toggle sprintdevs think cosmetics are contentgame is fun with friends but not very enjoyable for solo play after beating the story all thats left to do is grind levels pointlessly and find cosmetics theres no real reward for leveling up except unlocking monsters and increment increases of difficulty for your case files the main reason people want to play this game is to get scared not play prop hunt and roll loot box styled case files This tickles a horror game feeling in me I havent felt in a long time very much with early release Phasmophobia I highly recommend playing this with a party of four using the random maps its very fun Much screaming has been had Spooky this game is worth to buy lot of game mode to play please release the game and for developer keep it more update please LIKE THIS GAME Already a great game They have very responsive devscreator Theyre on top of everything and not to mention when they promise something they deliver Thank you guys for this absolute gem I love this game however my biggest and i mean biggest fucking gripe with this game is the monsters DONT FUCKING LEAVE AND PATROL THE SAME FUCKING ROUTE THE ENTIRE GAME WHEN THEY HAVE A MASSIVE MAP TO WORK WITH Like hello what am i supposed to go if theyre constantly on my ass but when i go anywehre else on the map theres no monster I have been playing this game with random folks and friends and even made some friends along the way I have learned some pretty neat things in this game and have had a lot of fun I love getting more people into this game and I am very excited to see how it progresses Case Files are incredible Great replayability for a really cheap game its a fantastic game whether you are playing solo or with friends  be patient with it cause it can catch you by surprise with the spooks \\ndefinitely recommend it as it is fun if given the chance This game keeps you on edge so often the ing cardboard ghosts get me sometimes Game is great what can I say Kinda sad I didnt buy it earlier  This is probably the best horror game ive ever played\\nIve never had this fun with my friends in ages when it comes to playing video games\\nIf you like horro games that you can play with you friends then this is absolutely one of the bests you can play for a cheap price I have had labyrinthine for a while Although I enjoyed what it had to offer at first they have updated it to such an extent that it is like a whole new game I highly recommend this game as the staffdevelepor are extremely friendly and helpful The game itself has a good amount of spooks and grinding making it a good choice for a variety of gamers Hopefully this review can help someone make a decision to get it Thanks for reading   pineapples Amaaaazing game The atmosphere is great and when I first played this I was terrified I have since then played repeatedly with several friends Please give this a chance and GLOWSTICKS So at first this game seems like one of the multiplayer arcadey style games but the story in it is actually fairly decent DEFINITELY play this game with friends as most of the fun revolves around teamwork and laughing over voice comms when theyre being chased by a demon I believe its the rd or th mission the Crypt level happens to actually be one of the best designed puzzlehorror maps Ive ever played They stuck to it when they named this game Labrynthine because thats exactly what is is Its a giant maze basically in the pitch black while skeletons and giant pig demons chase you down with chainsaws fucking brilliant and horrifying Since the cases update this game has become a weekly staple for me The mix and match of case challenges cosmetic pickups and solid map generation make for a highly replayable game\\n\\nMany more hours in I feel that the devs have a mixed relationship with cosmetic items Some are great and some are not seasonal items are often quite good mixed in with far too many things you already have \\n\\nTennis visor   Best CoOp Horror Maze Game out there no one compares what so ever Unlimited content and amazing first  chapters chapter  is still buggy As the highest level in this game I can say its pretty fun The grind is eternal  \\n Absolutely love this game Never a moment that I dont shit myself when I play Favorite chapter is  with Peppa La Pig lol The progression through the chapters at first starts slow but then it gets really good once you reach chapter   its a great online game \\n\\ni played it now for a couple of hours and i must say i cant get enough of it Its a very very great multiplayer game proximity chat works great Too bad it picks a lot of background noise Overall the VC is really awesome\\n\\nMaybe they can add a walkie talkie on batterys so you can talk from a distance with eachother not for long otherwise its not fun\\n\\nAnd maybe some lootboxes if you leveled  up or something like that\\nIts a great game and have a lot of fun playing online Spooky challenging and great fun with a group of friends I have a group I play with and we love playing the random maps together Sometimes frustrating sometimes easy but always fun We love the Oni and the Archiver is just a little friend Extremely fun annoyed by it but still very fun A few maps we played there was either no monster and sometimes we couldnt find the last thing needed to complete the map despite it being a small map which was really annoying but besides all that I would definitely still recommend\\n\\nUPDATE\\n\\nNow that its officially completed I can accurately say this is one of the best games I have gotten and one of my most favorite game to play with friends There is so much to do from the story line to casual play where there are generated maps that are and are not in the main storyline You can even customize your own map as well There is a never ending possibility for each maps as the sizes and difficulties range On top of that there are many things you can collect as you play The jump scares are my favorite most of all despite knowing its going to happen and is there it still blindsides me making my heart race I will allows recommend this game to my friends  I LOVE this game I love mazes my friends love horror its a perfect mix Except it takes us forever to do a small maze on hard because theres  monsters at the entrance \\n\\nMy fave maze is the new manor I cant wait to find the blueprint so I can free roam on a giant map of it If you are looking for a terrifying game that also is really good and you can have fun in with friends Then this is it I had so much fun while still being so scared of the game itself It is REALLY good Love the game just takes a while especially fun with a group of friends Great game to play with friends Plenty of jump scares to be had Some bosses are easier than others as are the maps love this game  Watching a lot of movies that involves mazes or horror has always had me wanting to play a game that has RNG mazes and isnt too overwhelming Labyrinthine is exactly that This game just has all around positive aspects a game needs to be successful Unique game play to make the game stand out Scary Very scary at times A very simple but satisfying progression system to get something out of playing mazes A great community with people always willing the help out new players and NO server requirement to play the game no seriously you can play on any server and the game runs completely fine and an amazing friendly development team that puts their love and care into the game keeping it updated with new content and listens to the community first and foremost in an organised discord because they understand the player base is what keeps their game alive\\n\\nNo pay to winplay micro transactions just pay to own and support people who deserve to be called developers Thank you Valko Game Studios You guys are amazing one of the best horror game out there Ive played though it several times and never get bored\\n\\neveryone buy this game Amazing Game and best part is that its in early access This game is such a vibe Jump scares puzzles use of strategy and the lovely sounds of your friends terror  The game is definitely worth it Story  are rather boring but from story  it really gets going Then you cant get away from the game Very good gaming experience\\n\\nFor the complete Story you need about    hours Fun to play with friends and a good game to turn off your brain to once you get used to the patterns of the monsters If you like Phasmophobia or other games at that level of spookiness you will likely enjoy this game Plus they have different colored glowsticks The puzzles are super fun and I love that they have added new aspects since my first playthrough It takes a lot of grinding to earn customizations in game like cute glowstick shapes but its a fun grind You can also find a bunch if you look hard enough It may seem overly difficult when you first do the story but its really helpful to read the tipsclues and learn each creatures behavior Overall it was well worth the money and I am here for the infinite glowstick tossing Seriously excited to see if they add more shapes D DID I MENTION THEY HAVE GLOWSTICKS  I hate the Wendigo I mostly like everything else though The game is definitely spooky but the Wendigo is not He is way too fast and there isnt enough fire in a map to justify his speed chasing you Also it is HELL if there is more than one wendigo on a map \\n\\nEdit The game seems to be less frustrating with the new update With that I can justify recommending the game Its nice to see the team is still adding new content into the game and making it a better experience I love this game so much Please make it more than  player tho cuz my whole family loves it and wants to play it together at the same time At least  player pleaseeeee Labyrinthine does a fantastic job at being a great late night horror experience and chaotically fun with friends The story is well balanced with mazelike and open adventure maps to please those who like either or with a variety of different abominations that lurk waiting to stumble upon your path The ambiances for each map is incredibly uneasy at times and will make you truly regret leaving the spawn room of any level or safe house\\n\\nYou can also do case files which are procedurally generated mazes with a random assortment of other parameters that are different from each and every experience you play These can also be manually tweaked for your own liking at the cost of Tickets you will be finding in other case files or as a reward \\n\\nNow with those fantastic horror elements absolutely nailed by the developers there are a few things that personally repel me from replayability and long term interest in the game These dislikes upon the following list are simply up for suggestion and foodforthought if youd think you will be concerned by the same bothers I have\\n\\n The movement is standard to every other horror game I have played Your character walks at a reasonable pace but for whatever reason refuses to move quicker then a light jog through a field of dandylions I understand the reasoning for the game design on keeping player movement low in general However in a realistic scenario I would assume anyone would Haul ass  away from any monster in hot pursuit I have had too many experiences with speed walking away from the swine with a butcher knife for him not only be able to catch me but also prepare a fullcourse meal in the time frame it takes me to get  meters down the hallway Being able to move at a greater speed temporarily or with consequence orand in addition of adjusting monster speeds for compensation would increase my enjoyment and excitement to keep playing\\n\\n Reroll tokens for CaseFiles are too few and expensive to buy with tickets I find it rather troublesome to gather reroll tokens over time through case file missions in addition of also spending tons of tickets just to be let down by the RNG Generation of Rerolling Case Files As a level  youd expect to be able to roll a grand variety of different case file variations without getting repeat maps but it tends to be my badluck and a waste of reroll tokens  It would be exceptionally better if tokens were easier to obtain in bulk cheaper to buy in tickets Or increase the value by making the RNG more skewed to different parameters then the map I expended a token for\\n\\n Collectable Cosmetics are visually different in texture but often share the same model across  different textures  A greater variety of unique models would bring more incentive to loading up a case file and searching for those lucky rare and hardcore special case files Where as I have lost interest in doing hardcore missions for the cosmetic that may be a different color then the others I have collected \\n\\n The Backrooms case files are by far my personal favorite levels to explore and experience Although im pretty sure the level was designed to be more of a jokenovelty level I think there is plenty of potential to be found by expanding the overall development regarding this level Additional monsters strange and unnatural findings and a variety of mindbending puzzles to be solved Overall I think this level type can have the most creative freedom for development and unimaginable horrors for players to experience\\n\\nAs I have stated previously the list above is my personal belief in making the game a bit more enjoyable through suggestions and personal experiences in Labyrinthine  It was not intended to be a insight of everyones suggestions and desires for the game \\n\\nRegardless of these few suggestions and issues This game is a must get simply for the fun horrors that can keep you busy for countless hours with friends\\n\\n The goto when youve got a full squad looking for some good scares laughs and memories Hahaha this game \\nIts horrifying Ive never yelled and screamed so much by a game before Buy it you wont regret This game made me edge the pigmen made me burst Clean up on aisle MY PANTS An awesome game for someone seasoned in horror but also for people who are new to the horror genre Tons of fun to play with friends and causes lots of laughs too Super creepy game and plenty to do you wont regret playing this with friends Absolutely love this game been dragging friends into buying it and playing it with me and were all addicted\\n\\nAtmosphere is done well in both story mode and the random case files it has yet to stop being spooky for us The hunt for cosmetics in the rarer and harder cases has ended up being a fun  part of it\\n\\nIn short great game Love it and look forward to what it holds in the future really scary but fun with friends  good laughs and many mini heart attacks haha If you play this game you wont need to have sex ever again every time i see the grandma monster i immediately bust This voluptuous lady is the best thing in my life at the moment Im glad my wife took the kids cause I cannot contain any sounds when i play this game this is the only form of hentai i need Pure pleasure when she proceeds to concave my forehead with her frying pan dont be afraid to do it harder Spooky and fun to play with friends Has a very active dev team that is great at listening and responding to players concerns and suggestions Very Nice game its pretty fun not that scary but the sound effects need to be fixed For example there are some monsters that are really really loud But overall very good game Its a very scary and thats what makes it fun to play with friends Good game for the boys plenty of content and replay value with added contracts This game quickly became one of my favourites Me and my friends always come back to this game even if its for the cases Weve played through all the current chapters and now play the cases often We find ourselves looking forward to the updates and playing the public testing branch as soon as we can Honestly I try to bring new people into the game as well because of how much i enjoy watching them try the game for the first time I look forward to watching this game develop further One of the games that just keeps getting better with new updates  \\n I love puzzles and this game combines it with horror in a great way But what particularly stands out is the fantastic support which I have never experienced in any game at this high level  Overall a great game and would love to see it get bigger Fun to play with ur friends Its actually scary the first times u play it Ive been playing this game for about a year and its one of my favourite horror games out there each map each case each chase Is completely different I love that each map is different and randomised it created endless fun that is always entertaining Keep up with the amazing updates It just keeps getting better  good game scary monsters variety amazing music Johnny Honks This is a great game to play with friends Full of monsters loud noises puzzles and jump scares I have many hours in this game and still play regularly Always a favorite Fantastic game Highly recommend playing with a few friends Great community and cant wait for more content Things that need to be fixedadded\\na stronger flashlight especially for the swamp chapter\\nthe ability to be able to respawn back at checkpoints instead of at the way beginning \\nthe ability to run faster because the run in this game is not much different than walking\\nmore character skinscustomization options \\npossibly adding directional signs that help to lead people different places in chapter  because its VERY hard to find where certain places are in Chapter  you kind of just have to wonder around and hope you end up there signs kind of like the dock sign in chapter \\nthe ability to get away from the slugs  They kind of just show up and kill you and you really cant outrun them\\nhave the glow sticks float in water instead of sink because its hard to make a path on water during the swamp chapter \\nwould be nice to be able to pick up notes and re read them whenever because those notes are helpful at times and I always forget what they said\\nadd a camera in the game so we can take photos of anything we find that may help us and to be able to view said photos whenever \\nHOW DO WE ESCAPE THE SLUGS IN THE SWAMP CHAPTER first one isnt to hard the second one the two mfs in there are op af cant do shit against one of them the other one doesnt like the light and if you get cornered gg mf you dead af the third was good i liked the house part and the puzzle for the attic just now starting the fourth chapter and its fucking scary has hell we just cant figure out how to i guess beat the pig guy other than trying to run away Me and my friend sang together with the witch while sitting in the campfire with Groot very beautiful slice of life game  good vibes It has been a lot of fun playing this with friends It always feels fresh with new ways to terrify us  Its fun but still in development so well see what gets added Amazing spooky game that definitely isnt spoken about enough With tricky puzzles creepy monsters that make you jump out of your skin and crazy mazes to navigate would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good jump scare\\nIt has an engaging story line and i personally cant wait for the next chapters\\n\\nMy only two complaints are that the proximity chat is a little buggy when playing with friends and the addition of a reconnection option so if somebody disconnected or has internet problems they can easily join their friends rather than restarting the whole chapter again Playing this game without watching someone play it first made this game feel really great to play Playing it solo can seem tough coop on the other hand SUPER FUN Def recommend this game for me  keep the chapters coming I would love to see more from this game The reason I say  is because sometimes the game has spots where the noises can be majorly louder than the rest of the game I wont say how because I do not want to ruin what happens in the game Other than that loved every second Actual good horror game good replay value and a strong dev team that actually cares what the players want for the game Very highly recommended especially for friend groups Very fun loads of entertainment value but its better with friends than by yourself Great game and would suggest with friends\\n\\nThe game has a good story and is a perfect difficulty \\nwhile being fun and being scary Since I played the th chapter im not sure anymore if I recommend it\\n\\nRating for each chapter\\n\\nb Chapter   b\\n\\nb Chapter   b\\n\\nb Chapter   b\\nIts okay But the Monster wasnt scary at all after a few minutes\\n\\nb Chapter   b\\nGood Jumpscares are better now and nice puzzels \\n\\nb Chapter    b\\nIts like a completely a different game Wtf is this chapter\\n\\nThere was like a big bee that is slowly comming to you and stings you and youre then dead There is no jumpscares in this map There is always like a warning you can cleary notice and see\\n\\nThis chapter was so boring and not fun at all My friends felt pretty much the same So much fun to play with friends I need more chapters and more maps and demons  this game is very awesome slight issue there is a game within the bugs \\n\\nkidding the bugs are hilarious lmfao i have allot of fun with it what else do you need to know First off if you like horror games puzzles or just a game that puts you on the edge of your seat Well this game is for you it has it all horror with jump scares puzzles and the atmosphere that keeps you at the ready for anything that can happen Fun game to play with friends Protip Mute Discord and just use VOIP Makes it much more spooky and fun when you get seperated from the group\\n\\nCase files is the way to go for replayability Story mode is cool to go through once but I think the meat and bones of the game lies in the procedural generation\\n\\nStill waiting for a labyrinth and minatuar combo This game is one of my favorites I enjoy it a lot more then phasmo and its endless mode is really fun The story mode is great and always improving with the newest chapter  being my favorite so far The Case files have so much potential and are already quite solid so I cant wait to see whats next to come Keep up the fantastic work devs Absolutely worth the price the videos dont do the games justice Been hooked on this since I downloaded it Tried this out with  friends which makes a full lobby\\n\\nGame is Early Access and it does feel like it could use more content at times when youve spent a few hours on it in one sitting However there has been gradually added more content at a steady pace with recent updates and it only gets better and better First impressions after exploring pretty much everything within the campaign and some randomly generated missions with my friends you get a sense of huge potential for this game Potential that is a closer reality for every update\\n\\nCampaign was super fun and entertaining as someone who is experienced with horror games it still managed to maintain both fun gameplay while surprising with well designed horror elements even for the experienced players \\n\\nNow to to the goodies There are missions that are randomly generated with everything else on the map so its a new map everytime with a bunch of varying factors to keep you intrigued and interested in playing Its super fun and only will only get more fun as the devs add more monsters with unique abilities along with other maps and objectives map objectives could use a little more creativity but it does it job so far\\n\\n I like the whole premise of the game Its a maze game where you have to collect objects to escape I wish that they updated the game more and added more chapters I also wish there was more glow stick colors and that the pig wasnt so incredibly loud  definitely recommend this game So much fun So much replayability especially if youre going for all those achievements Unlocked all  that are available now cant wait for the next chapter Chapter  So looking forward to it Okay so some of the levels mechanics can be really frustrating but if youre super competitive with a friends it turns into a fun thing If you like running and screaming while hearing your friends be violently slaughtered then this game is for you Our group was endlessly cackling while the gator monster repeatedly slaughtered our team mate after revival If you hope to stay together the whole game then kiss that hope goodbye Whether its the hedges cutting you off from one another or everyone just screaming and running in different directions you will not stay together the whole time This game is amazingly fun for groups  recommend and cannot wait for the new chapters havent had this much fun with friends in horror games for a long time this has been a refreshing experience absolute BANGER of a horror game  not all cosmetics are perfect and controls can be a lil wonky sometimes otherwise its such a good game pretty spooky for your first few times playing it can get a bit dull at times but I definitely still enjoy it and the puzzlesgame mechanics are still fun its still getting updates and has a good amount of playtime roughly like  hours for your first playthrough and can be enjoyed with friends which makes it x better cause of the stupidity I enjoy this game still in the works relaxing and fun It has a spooky atmosphere on each level and much diversity I like it  I enjoy the game only chapter I dislike is the pig one but really fun Will continue to play this game This is seriously so much fun Ive had so many incredible moments with online friends in this game Its the perfect mix of scary strategy puzzles and mazes\\n\\nThe main story chapters do fluctuate in difficulty but altogether make a very amazing experience So so so looking forward to the final main chapter and all the extras theyre putting into the game for replayability Devs are also very transparent and you can find almost anything you need looking through update logs\\n\\nVery fun very spooky have only screamed a couple hundred times Fun game to play with friends and puzzles are pretty easy This game has been great fun My only complaints are the inability to save mid level and how dark the game is Ive been playing this game since the day it came out and never really got around to reviewing it But by far this remains one of my favorite indie horror games Its come so far and even now out of early access its still got a lot of replay ability\\r\\n\\r\\nI love the puzzles the multiplayer aspect is by far my favorite and the challenge modes give you a good amount to do even after you finish story mode Most of the bugs I knew have since been fixed runs smoothly A good spooky game to play if you love mazes puzzles and running for your life Wow where to start \\n\\nIve been playing Labyrinthine since November th  When I first picked up this game I had no idea what I was in for Up until then I was playing Phasmophobia I knew Labyrinthine had to do with mazes but thats honestly all I was told The first time playing it the group of  I was with made it all the way to Chapter   The Crypt Honestly it was probably one of the most scariest experiences Ive ever experienced in a video game Goosebumps lasted about  hours after failing at Chapter  and calling it a night It took me a few days to play the game again after that because of it\\n\\nLabyrinthine for me provokes a response like no other I never thought I would scream from a game but boy was I wrong Right now Labyrinthines case files are my groups primary focus up until a new chapter is released Not going to lie the hype leading up to the new Chapter release is unmatched\\n\\nLabyrinthine is actively developed and the development team from all sides are extremely responsive and receptive They fully support their game and its refreshing to see The community they have built is also great and very welcoming\\n\\nSince installing this game back in November there have been a plethora of updates feedback and tons of development I am beyond excited and cannot wait for the future of Labyrinthine\\n\\nI cannot recommend Labyrinthine enough It is exciting fun scary intense amazing and if youre looking for a game that provokes those types of responses and more Labyrinthine is it this is such a well thought out game some of it is still in progress but everything thats live so far has been an amazing experience the atmosphere is nearly perfect with the balance of spooky ambiance and jump scares i play this game constantly really fun game it provides a unique experience compared to the other coop horror games out currently that are mostly reminiscent of phasmophobia it can get a little redundant sometimes when youre grinding for levels but i enjoy the harder difficulties of cases i like the story levels a lotchapter  has some complaints which are understandable but i personally enjoyed it a lot Great game for being an alpha if youre looking for a fun horror game with friends this is the game There are not many good scary games to play with friends but this game is one of the few If you are looking for a scary game to play with friends this is definitely worth a try Definitely more fun with friends  Playing the case files for a bit first makes it easier to finish the chapters  The chapters are a definite challenge  I am not a huge gamer love puzzles and mazes and I really enjoy playing this one with friends This game is the perfect thing for people who love all things spooky From the puzzles to the mazes to the monsters this game is all around one of the ibesti horror puzzle games that Ive played It can be tedious at times but thats what makes the game more fun With each chapter comes more brand new challenges that leave you anticipating what comes next and how youll get through the next puzzle without running into anything out to get you \\n\\nMy absolute favorite thing about this game is the fact that the lore isnt completely set in stone You can piece together notes to try and figure out what happened but ultimately its up to you to fill in the missing pieces and come up with your own storyline That and the fact that youll be fine one moment and hear your partner screaming from across the maze the next\\n\\nAll and all I cannot recommend this game more to people looking for team building exercises or just looking for a good scare This game is absolutely stunning and at the same time absolutely HORRIFYING I have replayed the game a handful of times all with different groups of people and have fun constantly every single time Along with the story side that currently has  chapters and they are still working on more They have procedural generated maps as case files that can bring their own horror with them Chapter  is one of the scariest in my opinion simply with the anticipation  I recommend this game for everyone I come in contact with I have about  hours in the game at the time of writing and Im sure I will be putting the same amount in soon if not more spoiler Not only that but the sheer amount of enemies that you need to constantly stay on your toes for as they all have their own unique mechanic My friends and I have played a lot of coop horror games but Labyrinthine has been by far the best I just love this game Each level has its own atmosphere and its own monsters and puzzles The gameplay is varied and always exciting because you are always shitting yourself or solving a tricky puzzle We had an incredible amount of fun with each chapter and we look forward to more content\\n A very good game and the developers are doing a nice job its pretty fun the maps can get too big but the small ones with a bunch of monsters are amazing to play with friends terrifying solo though does a good job of being a horror game scary and fun Great game but I feel it could do with a few more options when it comes to either \\navoiding defending against or hiding from the monsters Maybe some form of \\nweapons or written spells that you have to find by reading clues\\nIt would also be great if we could customise the character so that it was nearer the \\nperson playing like it is in some other games Obviously not sure what or how \\nhard this would be but it would be a nice addition in my opinion A more powerful \\ntorch instead of the  candle power one in game would also be nice and yes I \\nknow its to add to the immersion factor but still\\n\\nWould I recommend this game to people \\nMost certainly I would and have gifted it to family members already\\n\\n Great game to play with friends \\nI picked this game up on its beta and have enjoyed all of its content so far The developers work very hard and this is shown in there careattention to feedback developer news also creating new content for people to update their game and go enjoy\\nMy love for this game peaked and fell around chapter  when first dropping into the catacombs you get this true sense of oh shit i have no clue where i am and there are definitely going to be some serious threats With chapter s intense maze layout interesting puzzles and blood hungry monsters it is easy to get turned off from the game being that it is a polarizing challenge gap from the previous chapters But with some determination and so friends to get scared with its the peak of the game for me With all that said chapter  While it may be going back to a navigateable atmosphere and slowing things down again i will not say that it is bad Its not my first pick to be moving slowly through a large potion of the map but with threat that goes with said slow portions i can say that it will put you on the edge of your seat when it wants you too My only complaint at the moment for the game Chapter  is that other than the mosquito section there isnt really any niche mechanics to deal with the monsters Example Water areas platform to platform Small dog and Big dog try not to get seen he sees you youre pretty much gonna die just overall fairly sterile So in writing this review i would take the facts Its a fun ass game to play with friends you will get frustrated at times and there of points of high challenge and points of long walks So be patient and have fun  stars Chapter  is actual garbage Game itself has become extremely laggy and unreliable been kicked out of matches multiple times game freezes randomly which is basically a death sentence Unplayable This game has become one of my alltime favorites ever Ive played it since the day it was released and even now I play it constantly It is always a great time to have fun with friends or even kick back and run solo It always keeps me on edge and the cosmetic hunting holiday events and case file maps add so much replayability to the game The devs are also super sweet and are always finding new ways to add something more to it in one way or another It will always be one of our goto horror games I have no idea whats going on everything scares me and I have PTSD from Chapter  \\n\\n turn on proximity chat The devs are hardworking friendly and communicative and the multiple game modes and stream of content really keep you engaged A mustplay and a standout for people who like coop horror games I like the case file and randomness in the puzzlemaze solving Game is a hoot in moderation  can be a bit drawn out sometimes   great atmosphere building\\nSuper fun with buddies\\nOne big up is that i saw one of my main squeezes actually get scared in a game fantastic game tonnes of fun with friends The swamp update is amazing need more stuff like it Chapter  is my absolute favorite one so far The atmosphere is scary you have the feeling that you need to actually hurry up and run or youre going to miss your window for esacpingadvancing I loved the first three chapters the ambience horror monsters story etc were excellent Chapter  was just a subject of luck but you muscle through because its funny to hear your friends screaming as they get zombied \\n\\nChapter  is utter garbage All the ambience and story that drove the start of the game is gone to be replaced with a blurry swamp and shit monsters Delete the swamp level start again on chapter  with something good This game is so much fun nothing like panic running with your friends distant screaming int the background Each chapter has been fun to explore and I cant wait to see more Labyrinthine is one of the best horror game I have witness This game has a lot of Puzzles lot of mazes and lot of jumpscares Play this at your own dare  I love this game Ive been playing it since there were only the first two chapters out and it has come so far Its easy to get lost for hours pun intended or play a few case files just to pass some time  recommend you play this with some friends absolutely love fun game that is still in beta hoping they add more avatars and new maps This game is great when played with friends Each chapter is different with different challenges so it doesnt get boring the most recent chapter was only good because we all kept dying  laughing our asses off True jump scare horror game well worth the download Fairly entertaining until and including Chapter  where the difficulty increases making it semirage inducing but still fun nonetheless By chapter  the game feels completely different and loses some of its original charm with how the AI is placed and utilised albeit still sticking to the story and main premise overall Some really good jump scare and overall scary occurrences placed throughout although a little glitchy in places as well Overall a good game especially for an early access but could obviously still use work This game is definitely worth the money  \\nBUT I would like to see some changes  Ill tell about that at the end of my review\\nFirst im gonna say that this game is super fun and scary and makes you actually think  \\nFirst we played through the story mode All chapters were so much fun they were perfectly balanced It was hard but thats what it needs to be Doesnt feel very rewarding if you can just run through a game easily does it  \\nThen we started playing the case files We really liked that you will get new levels and difficulties and maps when you level up It really kept the excitement for us and also the fact that you never know what kind of monster you will get Also i think the leveling up is so balanced You actually need to play to level up and thats good Too many games nowadays make leveling up way too easy But also its not tooooo hard to level up so thats also good \\nAll the maps look amazing  NOW The bad stuff We dont really like that  map where the grass is so tall that you cant really see the glowsticks at medium range But i guess theres always this  map nobody likes so thats okay XD Just wish you could change the visibility a bit somehow \\nAnd now the second and last thing where i we would like to see changes Cosmetics \\nCosmetics in this game are super hard to get Too hard imo We have played a loooot and only got  case file with the blue seal thingy The cosmetic items arent even that good looking either sorry XD but they really are a bit generic looking and its already hard to get them you actually need to find them in game and actually need to klick on them and then WIN to obtain them So being that rare is a bit downside for us You need a lot of luck and then work your a off just to get  simple thing And the cosmetic items are something that keep us playing But when you dont get them it makes us lose interest in the game fairly quickly unfortunately So maybe make it more common for a cosmetic item to spawn\\nPS We also wish there was at least  different characters to choose from since you can play with  people \\nOverall a very good game but let us have more cosmetic items let us have the fun XD So incredibly underrated and undernoticed Ideally one day this game gets its time in the spotlight Hundo P best game with friends if youre looking for some good laughs and puzzles Game of the year Definitely should be a front runner i hate this game do not play  shit and piss everywheres will keep playing it tons of fun running through mazes while being chased by monsters with your friends I dont understand why they decided to make the AI so much more brutal in this update i get the previous versions where very tame but honestly i feel like theyve made it so difficult to navigate the maze as a group now with how efficiently they track and kill you combine that with the ridiculously small bleed out time and live system it makes for a very UNENJOYABLE time This would be the th or th time ive played through with new friends but sadly this wasnt an atmospheric spooky fun time like the previous ones \\n\\nI hope the devs can find a middle ground with the aggression of the AI Fun terrifying and hilarious Mostly terrifying Love the jump scares though they could be just a LITTLE quieter and all the puzzles Been playing for a while and still havent gotten bored with the procedurally generated maps Awesome game to play with friends Scary Insane very varieties of map and monsters Even the story mode ends theres still another mode that also very fascinating to play \\n\\nRecent update really makes the game much more complicated the whole maps feels much more bigger really even in a small map it still feels so huge than before and the road also so much difficult to trace since therere more dead end Truly an experience of labyrinth already took  hours in medium map imagine playing in a giant one Thanks dear developer Honestly one of the best horror games to play with friends I was definitely skeptical at first because puzzle games arent really my thing but I have been pleasantly surprised by how adaptable the game is You can really play this game however you want and still feel accomplished with what youre doing The jumpscares and atmosphere are amazing and you never truly get comfortable in the game like you do with some other horror games Definitely recommend picking this up if you get a chance Best horror game Ive played Its scary fun to play with a friend and the use of local vc really improves the game Chapter  is great chapter  is the longest chapter and the worst albeit in beta it still hurts to play through and I could not be paid enough to go through it again out of beta or not It sucks donkey dick and was the most unenjoyable gaming experience of my life\\nEdit I also experienced no big glitches the monsters are also uncreative unlike the previous levels and dont feel fair in places Even it not being a finished product is inexcusable for the amount of pure frustration you feel Very good game Would definetly smash the wickerman I wish I could refund this and get back all the time I wasted on this crap  This game is fantastic There are things that can get better and will get better with time I started this game off with a lowend PC that gave me loads of issues but Support through the official Discord was fantastic in helping me where they could \\n\\nHowever once I got a better PC the game plays so much better and I have next to no issues The game has insane amounts of replayability through Case Files which allow you to play a variety of mazes and difficulties \\n\\n recommend Love this game The puzzles are nice Have been looking forever for a game like this Plus this is where I met my boyfriend lol Its a good game to play with friends Officially the first player alongside my good partner Code to obtain all the medallions in Chapter  Good game would buy again B horror crust game\\nChapter  and  are eh but the the rest the game is fun Ok so my friend and I play this game alot We always look forward to the new scary maps and what kind of creatures are going to get us We recently played the new map chapter  that came out and that was very scary and loved that there was so many creatures depending on what section we were in The only thing Id say I wish it wouldve had is some kind of puzzle in the middle if the game for us to solve but overall very fun fuck your mom your dad your cousin your sister your brother and you creators fucking shit chapter  so Shut yo skin tone chicken bone google chrome no home flip phone disowned ice cream cone garden gnome extra chromosome metronome dimmadome genome full blown monochrome student loan indian jones overgrown flintstone x and y hormone post malone friend zone sylvester stallone ass up and fix your shit game\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter   This game is actually a really fun time if you have  friends to play with the monsters are pretty fun to mess around with and the campaign is enjoyable I developed several forms of PTSD  would play again simple scary stupid funny with friends and randoms great work in progress game where i cant wait to see whats next Game is fun Better with groups that keep it interesting The monster you face are very different and add to the challenge\\nLevel design is randomized and the levels get larger and more difficult as you level up\\nGame is very good for the price and looks nice as well\\nIf you like being scared and games where you are defenseless then give this one a try There is no sense of direction on the first map and the monster kills everyone instantly You also cannot play the other chapters until the first one is completed The game also continued running after I closed it racking up over  hours Now I cannot refund it I got scammed out of  that I could have put into a better game  tip do not play this game alone On another note Ive had this game since the beginning and every update makes the game even better A truly nice experience especially with friends  recommend Good with friends and good puzzles just that the jump scare is not that scary yet but overall its very good This game is so awesome the replay value is out the roof The Greatest multiplayer horror game of all time so much repeatability and difficulty variation you never get bored this is a game is something you will never regret playing with your mates the devs put alot of work in and you can really tell\\n\\n\\nPS Congrats on finishing the content devs\\n\\nEdit For those who cant handle this being game of the year this game is a amazing it has so much more to offer then  hours of game play like your reviews say play the game more each chapter offers different macanics for each monster and then after you finish all  chapters then you can move on to case files which is were most of the content is this game offers so much in the chapters then gives so much more in the case files they have way more map types objectives monsters and different types of monsters i have been following this game since its beta release and i have not been disappointing it was given heaps of love by the devs they put in so much work which is amazing to see and they even brought it out of beta and full released it how rare is that amazing job team ignore these people that are upset Love this game and the constant updates and love the devs give Highly recommend for fans of puzzles and horror combined For  this is one of the greatest horror games Ive played Its a simple idea for a game that is complex Updates are very good with lots of things to do and doesnt get boring This game is incredibly fun especially playing with groups of friends highly recommend Labyrinthine is great The main storycampaign mode is fun and runs about  hours depending on how clever you are The casesprocedural generation make for a turn of replayability and weve been playing together for hours Definitely suggest playing with friends Looking forward to further developments Its a good horror game to play with your friends until you get hit with a bug fix where the seals just dont spawn at all and youve wasted your time trying to beat a level for over an hour very good game cant wait to see what else this game brings in the future One of the best coop experiences Ive ever played After the content update Ive been playing almost every single day I have met amazing people to play with and really enjoyed it all Bacon and ghosties still get me every time c\\n lets hunt the cosmetics down \\n  Pro Tip Dont run from the Witch She just wants a hug\\n This game is superrrrrr fun It has a very unique story some fun puzzles its challenging but more or less fair And through the cosmetic system and procedural generation maps  it ends up having lots of replayability\\n\\nAlso the community is fantastic\\n\\nEdited In November  all of this remains true and the devs are continuously adding great and engaging new content Still highly recommended to try this if youre a fan of horror Honestly one of the best coop horror experiences you can have especially with the new procedural modes The enemy AI can get frustrating at times but given that the game is a work in progress Im willing to cut it some slack in this regard as its still super moody and fun\\nThe story mode has its ups and downs and doesnt have the most replay value I imagine it wouldnt be fun if one or more players in a group had already played it multiple times as most early adopters of this game would have One of the spookiest game Ive ever played  Fun with friends if you got one you dont Very addicting gameplay with the Procedural Generation game modes and the possibility of obtaining cosmetics with each map One of my top favorites A supportive communityoriented team always pushing out updates for making the game better and better They recently added XP Cosmetics and Case Files which gives this game more purpose to play than just a story line Its a grindable game and I love it Looking forward to what this games full potential will look like at release I love it even in early access officially the first person to find all the medallions on chapter  me and namas are the best labrynthine players to exist labrynthine is the best horror game to exist Love love love love this game Its such a super fun idea in itself that I was shocked a bigger studio hasnt hopped on the idea of horror mazes with friends The monsters are creative and fun to play against The mazes are all unique and different in their own way All of the puzzles are fun and have cute unique designs  All Ive seen from the devs are absolutely wonderful They are constantly coming up with amazing ideas and implementing or working on new content all the time This new procedural maze update is fantastic The devs also actively listen to the community and are always balancing the killers   changing gameplay They have a discord server and its amazing You can tell them about bugs or just ask questions and every time Ive gotten a response in literally a minute or less The lead dev was kind enough to give me a file of the music of the game that they hadnt uploaded to youtube yet For the price it is and especially for an early access game thats always getting new content this game is so worth it  Like I said the randomly generated mazes add a lot of replay ability and plus with the chance to get cosmetics makes them always fun to play  They have some maps that guarantee a cosmetic and even added hardcore exclusive cosmetics that are all really cool Theres seasonal events for unique fun cosmetics as well and now theyve even added an in game store where you can buy cosmetics and items that can help you in game play All without microtransactions Theyve added so much since I originally written this review that its insane I love this game and I recommend you get it Even if they never add anything else to this game its still worth  already and they are adding more and active in their community sign me up  Love you devs I wish you guys nothing but success \\n\\nEdit I removed the two negative criticisms of the game because they have since been fixed Like Ive already said such great amazing devs My old criticisms was the arrow puzzle was too slow to respond which has since been updated to be faster and now feels very good and that the monster screamskill sounds are too loud with no option to turn only that part down but now there is a separate option in the sound settings to turn them down And Ive added even more positives in my review since theyve added a bunch of new content since last time  Really fun and Scary but its also funny at the same time this game made me confirm i have a fear of mazes and being trapped in a maze\\n\\nupdate despite having more hours than i care to admit for having in this i am still very afraid of being trapped in a maze This game is great Me and a friend have been playing it for a few weeks and i have streamed it a few times\\n\\nPros this game is great and even tho the maps seem the same they slight differences in monsters changes it up a bit and makes it feel new \\n\\nCons cosmetic drops seem to low perhaps making it so when you level up you unlock them as well \\nduring the harder cases some monster combos suck like big foot and the witch or  witches for a medium difficulty seems to rough\\n\\nwitches seem really hard in general\\n\\nalso I have picked up the same red beanie  times now is that the only cosmetic  monkeys try to survive monster they keep trying to poke with a stick while one working brain solves the actual maze  would shit my pants from the ghosts when escaping a monster again and again and again\\n\\n\\nI enjoy this game much more than Phasmophobia and pacify Now when the game uses randomized levels and not only a story mode the fun never ends Tip for new players play some cases first to tacle one enemie at a time so you learn how to not get caught Jumping directly in to story mode was really hard at first not knowing how to survive TLDR YES BUY THIS GAME YESTERDAY\\n\\nLabyrithine is a very unique and fun horror game with friends Before the procedural generation update this was just one of those horror games where you played through the story a few times with friends and then just kind of forgot about it But now with the procedural generation mode where its a randomized level unlike the story mode which is the same levels every time it adds so much potential for replayability and new mechanics to keep us engaged Also there were a lot of performance improvements as well which made the game much much smoother Labyrithine is definitely not worth  in my opinion its worth more like  or  in its current state which makes this game a good deal And obviously over time it will become a better deal as the procedural generation mode as well as the rest of the game is more fleshed out with content\\n\\nPros \\n\\n Spooky\\n Only  which I think is a good deal and I think the game is worth  or  in its current state\\n Fun with friends\\n Fun with strangers\\n Plenty of content to be added in future updates\\n Good amount of content currently but the game still needs to be fleshed out a bit more but its early access\\n Replayability Again needs to be more fleshed out with more content for more replayability but for new players the amount of content should keep you occupied for a while\\n Good FPS smooth gameplay even for people like me with potato PCs\\n Good variety of monsters different gameplayAI mechanics story levels etc and overall very unique game Just lacking content for the procedural generation mode for the most part but it is still WIP and we will see updates to that in the next few major updates that will come\\n\\n Cons\\n\\n Good amount of content but still is lacking in some areas as far as content goes Solid game perfect blend of horror and puzzles to keep things interesting Its possible to play solo  with friends which is always a plus for those of us that like a challenge Sound design and atmosphere is simply chilling and the monsters beyond frightening I appreciate how each monster has their own mechanics and I cant wait to see what they add next Ana gelitiricilerden biri olmasam da  aydan fazla sredir ben de projede alyorumDikkat tarafl yorum Discord zerinden bol amatal bir grubunuz varsa coop olarak deneme deer bir oyun Hele benim gibi dlek biriyseniz arkadalarnz iin ekstra gzel olabiliyor I liked this game I wish people played it more though cause this shit was actually pretty scary ngl Im cappin this shit is scary Very fun Definitely still in development but this recent update has made replayability possible and its fun to play with friends Awesome game Theres different mobs with different ways to avoid them It makes the game intersting and gets you on edge all the time I loved chapter  the most but chapter  was for sure a challenge It for sure keeps up to the name of being a welldone labyrinth \\nGood times with good friends Would love to see a possibility to be  players insted of  if future maps get bigger Its fun to run around in teams of  players both to revive teammates but also to watch the other die a horrible death while you run away screaminglaughing youself Bad I bought wanting kirbys epic yarn Awfully displeased This is the first time i found a game where ppl are so nice and fun\\nMaybe because the game is still in beta version  but the staff is always open to any advices feedbacks and they are working so hard On the discord you can always find great ppl that are not agressive loud trolls\\nOtherwise I would like to say if you wanna play with friends this is perfect\\nIf you are alone or if you want a long game maybe wait the end of the beta test because its not easy to find ppl to play with and the game is still short at this point\\n\\nAlso you can easily struggle against monsters if you are only  ppl playing because its hard to understand how to escape against each monster One of the most entertaining multiplayer horrors Ive played Good variation of puzzles they were really interesting Maplevel design is amazing and the enemies really make you run for your life at least until you figure out how they work After a while the monstrosities sadly lose some of their scary charm \\nOne thing I really love is how audio works in the game Who doesnt enjoy hearing their friends dying screams in the distance\\n\\nI absolutely love the game so far\\nCant wait for level  So if you like horror games where you run into a scary maze while monsters are chasing you this game is for you It was very fun exploring each level of the game for the first time Would recommend to a friend hThis Game Is Greath\\n\\nNow that the game is fully released it is very entertaining to play especially with friends \\n\\nhStory Modeh\\nValko has now improved aspects of the stories and chapters I previously had problems with and the final chapter is fantastic Chapter  is still my least favorite but its unique compared to the other chapters If you play with friends I strongly recommend playing with the same proximity chat because it makes the game way more immersive and fun Storywise the six chapters are entertaining and depending on your navigation skills it may take a while to complete \\n\\nhPost Storyh\\nThe poststory mode is where the game gets even more fun with more maps monsters items cosmetics and puzzles to discover Not playing this mode makes you miss out on tons of content you can endlessly play since its procedurally generated The game is probably a  and deserves more social media attention great i enjoy playing this with friends puzzles is challenging  its spooky enough to make you sweat with pressure or panic  lots of jumpscares This game was great fun I played with my friends and it was a good experience i cant wait to see whats else they do in the future this game is very good if your into horrors jump out scares \\nsaw this game in sale so i just had to get it and try it and im glad i did its like a story you do\\nonce you do the puzzle and chapter the game saves so you dont have to do it again thats also what i like about the game there is no starting from scratch monsters are scary and they do chase you once there see you lol so just run like crazy and hope you get to meet back up with your friends P every chapter there is a different monster to scare you P in the maze you do and can get separated a lot cause the trees move and try and get you alone  so good luck P This game is extremely close to me and I love it with every fiber of my being \\n\\nFrom the start of the game it already has stunning sound design from the ambiance and noises from the monsters No matter how many times I redo this game with friends or solo yes I hate myself its always an amazing experience I am immediately immersed into the world the Developers made and because of that it never gets boring The ingame communications puts the game over the top when I get separated from my friends and I hear them for a split second you know Im going to scream out for them and when they dont respond or I lose their voice I am immediately terrified YOU WILL ALWAYS BE TERRIFIED even if its with three other people because there is always danger around every corner and the speed at which you can be separated is instantaneous \\n\\nI talk about each chapter individually so Im just gonna made it all a spoiler just in case\\n\\nspoilerChapter One is an amazing tutorial chapter as it lets you know this is going to be TERRIFYING The Second chapter is so much fun with such a creative level design and the unpredictability of every monster I love the looks of all the different places you have to go and the story lines with Officer Mills and Joan are really interesting to follow  The look of chapter three is very scary and the house design is amazing too although the monster could use a lot of work Chapter four is my favorite with AMAZING level design and monsters  I LOVE THE FEELING OF TERROR GOING THROUGH THE CATACOMBS an the jump scares with gates and skeletons are SO FUNspoiler\\n\\nIve followed Labyrinthines growth for a long time now and the developers are the best with community involvement and the continuation of the story I am always so excited when they announce an update and Im so happy they arent backing down like many other developers with these types of games Community opinions seem very important to them and my friend and I even got in the trailer where they showed different scares from the people who played \\n\\nAlso the future aspects they plan to implement are so exciting I mean with randomization a leveling system and new chapters I can safely say I will never get bored of this game I cant wait to see the revamp of Chapter  too \\n\\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH VALKO STUDIOS FOR MAKING THIS GAME  The absolute best horror game my friends and I have played \\n\\nIts terrifying its made so well the devs are actively improving and adding new maps its amazing with friends \\n\\nDefinitely recommend this game is boring af and the monsters are not scary best game all time so spooky i excited for next chapter so spooky and spooky I am Thoroughly spooked It is so much fun getting lost in mazes for what feels like forever and it totally evokes some of the genuine fight or flight feelings Without being able to fight It has major replayability already but once the update comes out that randomizes the mazes it will be even more so Love this game to death  Awesome game cant wait for more chapters to come out Highly recommend ps beware the jump scares I almost threw my mouse a couple times Absolutely an amazing game Ive played through the beginning of the games four phases and Im still constantly scared to make a move running through the woods and Crypt Despite it being early access the devs definitely know what theyre doing and are super friendly to their players as well I cannot wait for the next phase to come out and to see the ideas they come up with next h Third and hopefully final review h\\n\\nAs the title states this is me writing my third version of this review Since this game left Early Access and stuff has changed i had the need to adress some changes and ive made new experience along the way \\n\\n\\nMe and two friend picked up the game when there where only four of six chapters avaiable and no random generated cases \\nI first playthrough at this time was within one sitting and we streamed it on twitch The thruth is this a fond memory for me and happylie look back at it For horror games the first time is always the best And with beating the fourth chapter we couldnt wait for the rest to be released \\nTime got by and the game evolved and yet we didnt came back You know how things are planning to play this never became serious enough to happen\\n\\nThe game however devided itself into two things You had the story with six chapters and you had the Cases A mode where you needed to surive a randomly generated maze with certain amount of monsters on it I dive deeper into this later in this review\\n\\nSo almost three years went by and one of the friend that where there at the first playthrough traveled accross the globe for half a year to japan to make some unique experience At this time we both drifted game wise from each other We used to play a lot of SMITE together After some time abroad he stopped and join Guild Wars  while I iniatlly didnt like the game we lost common ground Our friendship was under pressure Id say and we rarly did some gaming together However after not being able to see each other we decided to play something We decided to play Labyrinthe and finished up what was new So we went replayed the first four chapters and tied up the lose end and enjoyed quite some time within the Cases \\nAfter and extensive amount of playtime we grow bored but managed to find more common ground and i even startiin grew found of GW so this game kinda sparked a second chance \\n\\nAt this time i rewrote the review for the second time And then the game left Early Access half a year later and in addtion some other friends picked it up So i took the other friend from the first playthrough and two newbies and replayed the story again While experience some of the new cases with the more experienced friend \\n\\nBut its time to talk about the game itself Starting with the chapters The chapters devide itself into  intense energy chapters and into  low energy chapter The first chapter is low energy and the introduction while chapter  and  are intense Energy Chapters What does this exactly mean\\nWell intense Energy Chapters contain a large pre build map with monster roaming arround and riddles to be solved You are being chased arround and likely to die here serval times Low energy chapters have less monster more riddle things Chapter one tells a lot of the story to set you up for the game While Chapter  plays more like a haunted Escape Room Chapter  is more like a walking and collecting simulator with astrayed and corrupted animals that are easy to learn and more annoying than scary Chapter  for me is the worst This more fault to hight expectation after returning to the game and left unsatisfied And got damned i hate that mosquito After fully experiencing the story two times and playing it to get some achievements without paying attention i can say that i like the beginning and dislike the end It suffers some problems Some of my friend might disagree and the liked the story However i felt that reason we did all what we did was not given It felt like we went on a search for a missing coworker and then ending up saving the world thing Since the game has no main characters it lacks the emotional journey of our figures I depens on how much the player empathize with the story or not On top of that the story is told differently depening on the chapters The first two have adio tapes and notes while the next two only have notes and piece of paper The final two have flashbacks notes and even talking people So most of the story is put into the some random notes scattered across the levels If you didnt bother reading dindt found all you kind dont knwo whats going on making the end a little weird \\nGameplay wise id say that the intense chapters  and  are the best the game hast to offer Even thought both are prebuild so they never changed in design and riddle solution they are fun to play I can live with chapter  it has works on its own because when entering a new game you dont know what to expect and even though you walk a straight path with a lot of story it scares the best properly Chapter  is fun for the haunted escape room part and the monster on the map is only dangerous the first time you encounter it In my later playthough ive never saw it and only heard once or twice Chapter  as said suffers the gameplay break They tried something different and for me it doesnt work The game doesnt have a complex gameplay its all about staying out of sight while solving puzzle in order to progress Chapter  use a differnt kind of enemies more bound to parts of the map while you need to find stuff The open part of the level is fun but if you missed one piece you need to back track alot and the enemies are more annoying than challenging Chapter  devides itself into three areas The first triey Chapter  in a much smaller scale and it has the only monster not avaible in cases The second part is the best and actually scary designed However it can get frustratin pretty fast tied to the narrow design of the level having no hideing possibality The final part is plain frustration I like the design thou You are in a giant maze like a litte rat in the kitchen But in order to not die you need pation to deal with the enemy In the playthrough we the newbies two of my friend could find the exit and it took hours to locate them and navigate them torward the exit while keeping them alive Its no fun at all \\n\\nWhich means onto the Cases Experiences \\nThe case are randomly generated mazes with monster choosen from a large variaty Best part here is that the designed mazes and mosnter exclusivly for the his part of the game so you dont get so the same thing from the story althought story monster are present in the case except for one As of now there a about  maze designs and more then  monsters Can remember the exact numbers As much fun as the cases are the have quite some issues \\nStarting with difficulty The diffculty is determinted by size and amount of monsters A small map with  Monsters is impossible to beat since you have a limited amount of lives to get you back on the feet There is this sweet spot of the right size in relation to amount of monster that make it an intense yet beatable experience Both extremes small with  monster or giant map with  Monster dont work The first might be more attractive then the later one However what does not change is the puzzle on the map The puzzles are simple Pull levers collect pieces or destory symbols Some mazetypes have there own stuff but its not harder then the basic once The wortst part is they dont scale A small map requires the same amount of levers to be pulled as does a giant one do And there are no two puzzles on a map All maps have one puzzle to be solved in order to escape \\nOnce you encountered and learned the basics about the monster and have some items to use the game becomes repatitive On top of that the only two rewards you get are tickets to buy items and cosmetic Cosmetic spawn randomly accross the maps and dont spawn always and you can find doubles aquiring all is random and a grind Not talking about rerolling maps to get the once you want You find create maps on your own but as long as you dont have stamps to make them hardcore have cosmetics you get nothing \\n\\nBut still to reach the point of saturation ive almost spend h and i still wanna play it since i havent found the end for me My friends and I had a lot of fun completing what the game has released BESIDES collecting the Jonny Ro books Chapter s collection of the books took  minutes Chapter  took  H O U R S to collect all of them with  people I saw a lot of people complaining that the jumpscares get oldthere is no incentive to stay alive because there is infinite respawning At first before playing I was hesitant to purchase the game because of it However After spending  hours to collect all of those books I am extremely thankful for the infinite respawning The jumpscares are more funny than scary in my opinion but I typically find this to be the case with most horror games Im glad I got this game now because once its done Im sure this will be a huge success Labryrinthine is a super fun coop puzzle maze with horror elements involved\\nI definitely recommend playing with friends as completion tends to go quicker with more people\\n\\nI really love how this game is coming along\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever those book achievements are brutal It took us almost  hours to do chapter s achievements \\nWe still love you though Johnny Ro\\n\\nEdit So after the update my friends who did all chapters with me never got their achievements I reach out to the devs and they said there was no hope of getting it back other than to rerun it or put your computer at risk by going through files While I know this isnt necessarily their fault it just really sucks that all of those hours were wasted Additionally it took multiple times for them to even respond My friend reached out to them  times and his question was ignored Only when I reached out twice did they give a response A mostly simple game that looses its scare factor pretty quickly \\nI did play through all the chapters available and enjoyed each one The scary parts are usually unexpected and if you arent a horror snob chances are you will enjoy it for the spooky atmosphere and the mazepuzzle aspects of it I played it coop and had a blast now I am trying to get my friends to replay it with me until the updates come out\\n\\nUpdate  hrs in The new maps and cosmetics really added to this game I also enjoy the hardcore levels as well as the ever changing generation of maps I wish the events were longer or that there were more of them Possibly some customization for your players I keep coming back to this game even thought I have played it all so thoroughly So fun it was scaryfun and challenging game Waiting for chapter   Amazing game\\n\\nhttpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsvideomp Me and a friend have had a few sessions at this game now Each time we attempt chapter  we are unable to solve the puzzle with the tiles you have to match Within  seconds of standing in front of it the pig runs in and kills you We then had to negotiate our route back to the puzzle  or  times to be killed by the pig again and again How are you supposed to have time to solve the puzzle Youre not given a chance The pig is on your your case no matter what you try or do Very fun and frustating at same time recommended to play with friends Love this game Challenging and fun Cant wait to try out the new zone with my family The game is a piece of shit You cant save the game which is stupid we have lives too you know AND who the fuck makes a game that once kicked off the server for some reason you can go back to that game you have to start all over again like how stupid mate if i could give a minus review here is where it would lie I love this game so much The developers are doing such a wonderful job with this game and I cant wait for more Ive been playing and following this game since  dedicated Developer team and has given me and my friends many laughs and scares Perfect coop horror game to find puzzles and run away from the monsters I played all the way till the end before they released the crypt It was still really fun from what I had played and just recently got it for my friends and I and really enjoyed what they have done so far with the game There are a few things Ive noticed though on my second play through I wish we knew how to hide better from the monsters as well as have a save option We played and didnt complete the second chapter and we had to start all over It was tiring I also think the monsters glitch every now and then and dont move from the spot they are pacing\\nIts still early on so I think that this game has real good potential I would def recommend this game If looking for puzzles and group gamethis is the one Spooky and fun This is another big edit of my second review as unfortunately many of the concerns with the gameplay remained and the progressively decreasing quality of the product led to chapter  and the final release completely wasting the otherwise deep story of the game I need to once again open the discussion as of the recent unethical and free speech restrictive actions caused by this Dev\\n\\nI never stopped saying how the game had great potential with its innovative approach and promising young talents on the team that I had the possibility to talk with It all started when I and a few friends became active in the Discord community channel where we got the opportunity to test the game in a private test branch Not all people were truly dedicated to help out with the development of the game and as many have already mentioned they divided the community by having favorites who basically started acting abusively and created a cult like atmosphere They received special treatment and at the same time those who provided real feedback and helped additionally with the best intents were getting ignored and sometimes silenced \\n\\nSince recently things have once again escalated Ill briefly mention the issues that still remain with the gameplay that include the game being way too dark even at  brightness where you cant see anything despite years of feedback the ticketing system being nonrewarding and the achievements never saving progress so even if you bought everything on the shop previously youll need to respend tickets which are gained extremely slow People describe the game as being a Walking Simulator which unfortunately could be viewed as a valid point due to the AI the maps size and the slow walking speed \\n\\nConsidering what I said me and a few others were labeled as liars and were guilt tripped into believing that we imagine weaknesses in the gameplay mechanics because we felt like the monsters always know your exact location which was leading to the monsters camping at your location despite we had  hrs in the game and we developed deep knowledge about  it Later on in a post the Dev mentioned that the Miner is roaming at higher speed while hes far away from you so he can stick close to you at all times imagine having  monsters and only one long corridor to enter the mapit really does result in the AI preventing you from entering the maze for quite some time which creates the illusion of him knowing your exact location\\n\\nAs you may see theres a good amount of negative feedback today because of the way things are handled and when I did my first edit of a previously positive review it was about  months ago Thats when I got removed from the private testing branch The reason was that I gave my honest review of the games direction and mentioned the bad approach to feedback including the attitude towards the players Having said that the Dev definitely lacks the professionalism as its not ok to pursue people into turning their review to a positive one by replying to  of the negative reviews making faultfinding comments He obviously didnt like me saying that so I was personally confronted by him and thats when I got removed from the test branch\\n\\nToday I do not play the game regularly but after seeing that this inappropriate silencing technique continues with players getting doxxed I decided to write a negative but in accordance with Steams guidelines comment on their Hub post that requests from players to vote Labyrinthine as the VR Game of the Year Since the Dev obviously didnt like that as well he banned me permanently from the community Hub so I cannot post anything anymorethis just shows the total lack of any professionalism that a real successful businessman will have \\n\\nAs I already mentioned in my deleted comment this attempt of silencing people is not unnoticed and real criticism will continue to float to the surface Players pay for these games with their own money and no Dev has the rights to restrict the freedom of speech\\n Honestly a fun game the maze is eerie and large with challenging puzzles  foes attempting to thwart your attempts\\n\\nHidden lore is also there for you to further explore if you pluck up the courage and find it\\n\\nWhile its a bit of a buggy mess for the fact it only went live a few weeks ago it is extremely engaging and fun to play with friends The maze has multiple ways of testing your sanity and its going to push you no matter what you try\\n\\nThe devs are active and engaging with the community and are happy to help guide you or laugh at your panicked misery depending on the day Quite a short game if you have  friends playing it together'"
